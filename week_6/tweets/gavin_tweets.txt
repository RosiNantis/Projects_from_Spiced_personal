@FractalFlows @Polkadot The DOT in the treasury comes as a natural part of the network protocol. Fees, slashes and suboptimal staking configurations are all contributing factors. If it goes unused, it slowly gets burned. It currently burns 239,988 DOT every month.

Quite possibly the first tightly-coupled cross-chain token application between @kusamanetwork parachains. @Polkadot https://t.co/FV65kahDrm

@FractalFlows @Polkadot The DOT in the treasury comes as a natural part of the network protocol. Fees, slashes and suboptimal staking configurations are all contributing factors. If it goes unused, it slowly gets burned. It currently burns 239,988 DOT every month.

The @Polkadot treasury currently has 18,936,300 DOT (DOT, not USD - do the math) in it ready to spend on *your* ideas for building, improving, educating and indeed, anything else that the Polkadot governance believes valuable.
