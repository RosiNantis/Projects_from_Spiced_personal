I can hear the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain
Oh, something's a-telling me i wear the ball and chain.
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He's always off somewhere when i need him most.
The spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin' me i love ya still.
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, i begin to swoon.
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore i finally disappear?
Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.
But me, i can't cover what i am
Wherever the children go i'll follow them.
I march in the parade of liberty



But as long as i love you i'm not free.
How long must i suffer such abuse
Won't you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose?
I've given up the game, i've got to leave,
The pot of gold is only make-believe.
The treasure can't be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me i love ya but you're strange.
One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it.
