I ain't lookin' to compete with you,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Simplify you, cla**ify you,
Deny, defy or crucify you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
No, and i ain't lookin' to fight with you,
Frighten you or tighten you,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Chain you down or bring you down.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I ain't lookin' to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up,
an*lyze you, categorize you,
Finalize you or advertise you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't want to straight-face you,



Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Or define you or confine you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't want to meet your kin,
Make you spin or do you in,
Or select you or dissect you,
Or inspect you or reject you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't want to fake you out,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me,
See like me or be like me.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
