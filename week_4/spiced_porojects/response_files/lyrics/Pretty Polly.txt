Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
I'm scared you will lead my poor body astray
Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
Well, Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
For I dug on your grave the best part of last night
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
I can't k** a woman that loves you such as I
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
He drew out his dagger all in his right hand



He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run
He pierced her in the heart the lifeblood did flow
Deep in her grave Pretty Polly did go
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
With nobody there but the wild birds to moan
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
For k**ing Pretty Polly and running away
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand
