[Verse 1]
I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
Some fat momma
Kissed my mouth one time
[Verse 2]
Well, I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
My suitcase is packed
My clothes are hangin' out
[Verse 3]
San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun



San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun
But I'm used to four seasons
California's got but one
[Harmonica solo]
[Verse 4]
Well, I got my dark sungla**es
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sungla**es
And for good luck I got my black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'
I just might tell you the truth
