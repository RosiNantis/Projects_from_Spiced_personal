Your mother, you f**in' f*got
La da da, da da da, da da
La da da, da da da, da da
La da da, da da da, da da
Aiyo, this next song is
Dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget
About you, you f**in' h*mo
We still remember
There once was a man
Who liked to jump around
(Jump around)
But he got too old to jump up and down
(Up and down)
(So then what happened?)
So he put the mic down
And picked the guitar up
(Picked the guitar up)
(And then he what?)
Started singin' the blues
Like there's no tomorrow
(No tomorrow, come on)
Left his boys in the house of pain
(The house of pain)
It was the wisest decision he ever made
(Ever made)
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
I remember back when you had
The Knack
(Had the knack)
And I remember when you had
Your first heart attack
(Heart attack)
I was right there laughin'
When I heard the news
(Heard the news)
I just wish the cardiac
Would'a murdered you
(Would'a murdered you)
Maybe Ice-T's right
You are a b**h
(You are a b**h)
You come around when you're broke
And you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
Remember back in '94, like right before
Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When house of pain was out of fame
Like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again



Or even further back, when I first had heard The Knack
And you were down with Syndicate
I went to get your sh**, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the sh**
Now you sound ridiculous you dick less piece of sh**,
How could you diss me, b**h?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech
When I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin', then you left the room
And didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you was mad that someone else was
White and tried to rhyme or somethin'
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin' to steal your light or nothin'
But you're a h*mos**ual, white rappin' Irish f*got
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a f*got too
Then I'd be confused as you
And I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you?
I never f**ed with you
Why would you f** with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you
What, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you
And I don't f**in' sing
And probably play guitar better
And I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, sh** you was me in '92
So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you
And maybe that will help me know
What it's like to sing the blues
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
You f**in' punk, p**y
You f**in' f*got, sissy, f**
And by the way, a three-eighty's a f**in' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a f**in' real gun
You little b**h
Next time say
My f**in' name in a song
Don't be subliminal about it
You wanna f**in' diss me
Diss me you f**in' f*got
You f**in' punk, p**y
You f**in' little b**h, f**in' c*nt
