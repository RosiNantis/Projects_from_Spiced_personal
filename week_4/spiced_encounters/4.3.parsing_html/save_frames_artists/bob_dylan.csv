0,As Time Goes By,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/triplicate/as-time-goes-by.html,bob_dylan,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date



Hearts full of pa**ion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by"
1,I Shall Be Released,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/blood-in-my-eye/i-shall-be-released.html,bob_dylan,"They say every man must need protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd



Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released"
2,All Or Nothing At All,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/fallen-angels/all-or-nothing-at-all.html,bob_dylan,"All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all
All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all
Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek



Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say ""No, no""
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all"
3,Bye Bye Johnny,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/live-on-air-1986/bye-bye-johnny.html,bob_dylan,"Bye and bye
I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
Well, I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye
On you I'm casting my eye
I'm paintin' the town
Swinging my partner around
Well, I know who I can depend on
I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads, I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town
Making my last go-round
Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin'
And I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even acquainted with my
Own desires
I'm rollin' slow



I'm doing all I know
I'm tellin' myself
I found true happiness
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow, goin' where the wild roses grow
Well the future
For me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love
And you will be my last
Papa gone mad, mamma, she's feeling sad
Mamma, she's feeling sad
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be"
4,Jet Pilot,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-bootleg-series-vol-12-the-cutting-edge/jet-pilot.html,bob_dylan,"Well, she's got jet pilot eyes from her hips on down.
All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town.
She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.



She got all the downtown boys, all at her command
But you've got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman
She's a man.
"
5,California,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-bootleg-series-vol-12-the-cutting-edge-collectors-edition/california.html,bob_dylan,"[Verse 1]
I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
Some fat momma
Kissed my mouth one time
[Verse 2]
Well, I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
My suitcase is packed
My clothes are hangin' out
[Verse 3]
San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun



San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun
But I'm used to four seasons
California's got but one
[Harmonica solo]
[Verse 4]
Well, I got my dark sungla**es
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sungla**es
And for good luck I got my black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'
I just might tell you the truth"

Baby let me follow you down

Can I come home with you?
Baby can I come home with you?

Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.



Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'."
9,Pretty Polly,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/gaslight-nyc-sept-6th-1961/pretty-polly.html,bob_dylan,"Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
I'm scared you will lead my poor body astray
Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
Well, Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
For I dug on your grave the best part of last night
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
I can't k** a woman that loves you such as I
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
He drew out his dagger all in his right hand



He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run
He pierced her in the heart the lifeblood did flow
Deep in her grave Pretty Polly did go
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
With nobody there but the wild birds to moan
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
For k**ing Pretty Polly and running away
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand"
10,Autumn Leaves,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/shadows-in-the-night/autumn-leaves.html,bob_dylan,"The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away



The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall"

13,Duquesne Whistle,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/tempest/duquesne-whistle.html,bob_dylan,"[Verse 1]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away
I wanna stop at Carbondale and keep on going
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp
But I ain't neither one
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Sounding like it's on a final run
[Verse 2]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she never blowed before
Blue light blinking, red light glowing
Blowing like she's at my chamber door
You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you always smiled before
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more
[Verse 3]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going
You're like a time bomb in my heart
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling



Must be the mother of our Lord
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like my woman's on board
[Verse 4]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' k** me dead
[Verse 5]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing through another no good town
The lights on my native land are glowing
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she's blowing right on time"

To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
Ah'll do anything with you
Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road
With my head in my hand
I'm lookin' for a woman
Needs a worried man
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
'Low me just-a one more chance
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your aeroplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your pa**enger train
Well, I've been lookin' all over



For a gal like you
I can't find nobody
So you'll have to do
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
'Low me just-a one more chance
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
Ah'll do anything with you
Well, lookin' for a woman
That ain't got no man
Is just lookin' for a needle
That is lost in the sand
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
'Low me just-a one more chance"
15,When Did You Leave Heaven,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/original-album-cla**ics-the-80s/when-did-you-leave-heaven.html,bob_dylan,"I used to dream about angels But then I never knew
That I'd ever meet one And such a sweet one
Till I met you
When did you leave heaven? How could they let you go?
How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things
Where di you hide your Halo?
Where did you lose your wings?
Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?
If Ikissed you would it be a sin?
I amonly human but you are so divine



When did you leave Heave, angel mine?
When did you leave heaven? How could they let you go?
How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things
Where di you hide your Halo?
Where did you lose your wings?
Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?
If Ikissed you would it be a sin?
I amonly human but you are so divine
When did you leave Heave, angel mine?"
16,All Over You,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-bootleg-series-vol-9-the-witmark-demos-1962-1964/all-over-you.html,bob_dylan,"[Verse 1]
Well, if I had to do it all over again
Babe, I'd do it all over you
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years
Babe, I'd even do that too
Well, a dog's got his bone in the alley
A cat, she's got nine lives
A millionaire's got a million dollars
King Saud's got four hundred wives
Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'
That they're looking' forward to
I'm looking' forward to when I can do it all again
And babe, I'll do it all over you
[Verse 2]
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today
Babe, I'd run circles all around
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin
I'd even dance a jig on the ground
Well, everybody gets their hour
Everybody gets their time
Little David when he picked up his pebbles
Even Sampson after he went blind
Well, everybody gets the chance
To do what they want to do
When my time arrives you better run for your life
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you
[Verse 3]
Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny



Baby, and my days are gonna come
And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant
When you hear me yelling', “Fee-fi-fo-fum”
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle
You made me to a walk-in' wreck
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone
Then you knocked off my head from my neck
Well, if I'm ever stand-in' steady
A-doin' what I want to do
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you
[Verse 4]
I'm just resting' at your gate so that I won't be late
And, momma, I'm a-just sitting' on the shelf
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squatting' there
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumbling' to myself
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up
After all my liquor's been drunk
After my dreams are dreamed out
After all my thoughts have been sunk
Well, after I do some of these things
I'm gonna do what I have to do
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you"
17,Pretty Peggy - O,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-original-mono-recordings/pretty-peggy-o.html,bob_dylan,"I've been around this whole country
But I never yet found Fenneario.
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down
Well, as we marched down to Fennerio'
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O
What will your mother say to know you're going away
You're never, never, never coming back-io ?
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O



Come a-running down your stairs
Combing back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io.
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O
The lieutenant he has gone, long gone
He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Well, our captain he is dead, our captain he is dead
Our captain he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O
Well, our captain he is dead, died for a maid
He's buried somewhere in Louisiana-O."
18,Christmas Blues,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/christmas-in-the-heart/christmas-blues.html,bob_dylan,"The jingle bells are jingling
The streets
Are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joys



But friends when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls
And little boys May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear
Oh Santa
May have brought you
Some stars for your shoes But Santa only brought me
The blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered
Christmas blues Oh Santa
May have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me
The blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered
Christmas blues"
19,Beyond Here Lies Nothin',https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/together-through-life/beyond-here-lies-nothin.html,bob_dylan,"Oh well, I love you pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' we can call our own
Well, I'm movin' after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' but the moon and stars



Down every street there's a window
And every window's made of gla**
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothin'
But the mountains of the past
Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me, pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' done and nothin' said"
20,'Cross The Green Mountain,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-bootleg-series-vol-8-tell-tale-signs/cross-the-green-mountain.html,bob_dylan,"I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream
Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream
Somethin' came up out of the sea
Swept through the land of the rich and the free
I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then I ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet
Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide
The foe has crossed over from the other side
They tip their caps from the top of the hill
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill
Along the dim Atlantic line
The ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avengin' God
The world is old, the world is gray
Lessons of life can't be learned in a day
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand
To the music that comes from a far better land
Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend
k**ed outright he was, by his own men
It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year



I feel that the unknown world is so near
Pride will vanish and glory will rot
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot
The bells of the evening have rung
There's blasphemy on every tongue
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light
And that I was loyal to truth and to right
Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn
In the deep green gra**es of the blood stained wood
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood
Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost
The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost
A letter to mother came today
Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed
But he'll never be better, he's already dead
I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away
In an ancient light that is not of day
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell"
21,A Hard Rain's a - Gonna Fall,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/dylan-3cd/a-hard-rains-a-gonna-fall.html,bob_dylan,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard



And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall"
22,Ain't Talkin',https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/modern-times/aint-talkin.html,bob_dylan,"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine
I was pa**ing by yon cool crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind
Ain't talking, just walking
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burning, still yearning
No one on earth would ever know
They say prayer has the power to heal
So pray for me, mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I am trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't going well
Ain't talking, just walking
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burning, still yearning
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
Now I'm all worn down by weeping
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
Ain't talking, just walking
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking through the cities of the plague.
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down
Ain't talking, just walking
Eating hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.
Heart burning, still yearning
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every waking moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour 



I'll revenge my father's d**h then I'll step back
Ain't talking, just walking
Hand me down my walking cane.
Heart burning, still yearning
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.
All my loyal and my much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
Ain't talking, just walking
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.
Heart burning, still yearning
Thinking about that girl I left behind.
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dying
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?
Ain't talking, just walking
Carrying a dead man's shield
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking with an ache in my heel
The suffering is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears
Ain't talking, just walking
Walking ever since the other night.
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking until I'm clean out of sight.
As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone
Ain't talking, just walking
Up the road, around the bend.
Heart burning, still yearning
In the last outback at the world's end.

23,Blowing In The Wind,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/no-direction-home-the-soundtrack-the-bootleg-series-vol-7/blowing-in-the-wind.html,bob_dylan,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head



And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many d**hs will it take 'till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind"
24,Chimes of Freedom,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-bootleg-series-vol-7-no-direction-home-the-soundtrack/chimes-of-freedom.html,bob_dylan,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales



For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chaineded an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing"
25,I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Met),https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/bootleg-series-vol-6-bob-dylan-live-1964-concert-at-philharmonic-hall-sacd/i-dont-believe-you-she-acts-like-we-never-met.html,bob_dylan,"I can't understand, she let go of my hand
An' left me here facing the wall
I'd sure like to know, why she did go
But I can't get close to her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here
She acts like we never met It's all new to me like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it's hard to think on that she's the same one
That last night I was with From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk
'Stead of acting like we never met If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt, she seems too far out
For me to return to her chase Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played



Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed for she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess
To anything I might've tried
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide Though the night ran swirling an' whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to, I can be just like you
An' pretend that we never have touched An' if anybody asks me, ""is it easy to forget?""
I'll say, ""it's easily done
You just pick anyone
An' pretend that you never have met"""

There's something you must see
I want to be with you, gal
If you wanna be with me
But if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now

It ain't that I'm questionin' you
To take part in any quiz
It's just that I ain't got no watch
And you keep askin' me what time it is
So if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now

But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
That I ain't got any respect

But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night

And [Incomprehensible], too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do
So if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
It ain't that I'm wanting
Anything you never gave before
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon

27,Abandoned Love,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/biograph/abandoned-love.html,bob_dylan,"I can hear the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain
Oh, something's a-telling me i wear the ball and chain.
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He's always off somewhere when i need him most.
The spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin' me i love ya still.
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, i begin to swoon.
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore i finally disappear?
Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.
But me, i can't cover what i am
Wherever the children go i'll follow them.
I march in the parade of liberty



But as long as i love you i'm not free.
How long must i suffer such abuse
Won't you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose?
I've given up the game, i've got to leave,
The pot of gold is only make-believe.
The treasure can't be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me i love ya but you're strange.
One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it.

One, two, a-one two three
In the lonely night
In the shadows of a pale moonlight
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams.
I walk alone through the shakin' street,
I'm a-listenin' to my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time.
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Not this time, i'll have no more of this.
It's much too cruel, it's much too cool, way too revealing.
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma,



Oh babe, how you left me reelin' with this feelin'.
Up on the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I held you close and got what i deserve
Where we were born in time.
You pressed me once, pressed me twice,
You hang the flame, but you'll pay the price.
Oh babe, and that fire is still smokin'.
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, lord and you were plain,
Oh babe, truer words have never been spoken or broken.
In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what's left of me,
Where we were born in time.

29,Bye & Bye,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/love-and-theft/bye-bye.html,bob_dylan,"Bye and bye
I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
Well, I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye
On you I'm casting my eye
I'm paintin' the town
Swinging my partner around
Well, I know who I can depend on
I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads, I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town
Making my last go-round
Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin'
And I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even acquainted with my
Own desires
I'm rollin' slow



I'm doing all I know
I'm tellin' myself
I found true happiness
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow, goin' where the wild roses grow
Well the future
For me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love
And you will be my last
Papa gone mad, mamma, she's feeling sad
Mamma, she's feeling sad
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be"

Leave at your own chosen speed.
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I'm not the one you need.
You say you're lookin' for someone
Never weak but always strong,
To protect you an' defend you
Whether you are right or wrong,
Someone to open each and every door,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Go lightly on the ground.
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I will only let you down.
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part,
Someone to close his eyes for you,



Someone to close his heart,
Someone who will die for you an' more,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Everything inside is made of stone.
There's nothing in here moving
An' anyway I'm not alone.
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
To gather flowers constantly
An' to come each time you call,
A lover for your life an' nothing more,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe."
32,4th Time Around,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/live-1966-bootleg-series-vol-4/4th-time-around.html,bob_dylan,"When she said,
""don't waste your words, they're just lies,""
I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,
Then said, ""what else you got left?""
It was then that i got up to leave
But she said, ""don't forget,
Everybody must give something back
For something they get.""
I stood there and hummed,
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
And she bu*toned her boot,
And straightened her suit,
Then she said, ""don't get cute.""
So i forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.
She threw me outside,
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.
And after finding i'd
Forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.



I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
And i tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against . . .
Her jamaican rum
And when she did come, i asked her for some.
She said, ""no, dear.""
I said, ""your words aren't clear,
You'd better spit out your gum.""
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor,
And i covered her up and then
Thought i'd go look through her drawer.
And, when i was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you.
And you, you took me in,
You loved me then
You didn't waste time.
And i, i never took much,
I never asked for your crutch.
Now don't ask for mine.

Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Well, you must tell me, baby
How your head feels under something like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 2]
Well, you look so pretty in it
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just want to see
If it's really that expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 3]
Well, if you want to see the sun rise
Honey, I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime
We'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt
Wrapped around my head



And you just sittin there
In your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 4]
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
It's bad for your health, he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you
But I found him there instead
You know, I don't mind him cheatin on me
But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 5]
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
You know, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you making love with him
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for:
It's your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat"
34,'til I Fell In Love With You,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/time-out-of-mind/til-i-fell-in-love-with-you.html,bob_dylan,"Well my nerves are exploding and my body's tense
I feel like the whole world gonna end up against the fence
I've been hit too hard, seen too much
Nothing can heal me now but your touch
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.
Well, my house is on fire, burnin' to the sky
Well, I thought it would rain but the clouds pa**ed by
And I feel like I'm comin' to the end of my way
I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray
Still, I don't know what I'm gonna do
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.
Boys in the street beginnin' to play
Girls like birds, flyin' away
When I'm gone you will remember my name
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame



Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.
Well, junk's pilin' up, takin' up space
My eyes feel like they've fallen off my face
Sweat pourin' down, I'm starin' at the floor
I'm thinkin' about that girl who won't be back no more
I just don't know what to do
I was all right 'til I fell in love with you.
Well, I'm tired of talkin', I'm tired of tryin' to explain
My attemps to please ya, they were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If I'm still among the livin' I'll be Dixie bound
Still, I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was all right, 'til I fell in love with you."

And I thought of you
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kind of wondered
If you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or over-step the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me



Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying,
It's the last temptation
The last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
The last radio is playing
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away
Tomorrow will be another day
Guess it's too late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away"

I'll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive.
She been gone ever since I been a child
Ever since I seen her smile, I ain't forgotten her eyes.
She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies.
I been good, I been good while I been waitin'
Maybe guilty of hesitatin', I just been holdin' on
Seven more days, all that'll be gone.
There's kissing in the valley,



Thieving in the alley,
Fighting every inch of the way.
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
In a night that's always brighter'n the day.
Seven days, seven more days that are connected
Just like I expected, she'll be comin' on forth,
My beautiful comrade from the north.
There's kissing in the valley,
Thieving in the alley,
Fighting every inch of the way.
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
In a night that's always brighter'n the day."

Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby
I don't care what in the world you do.
I went back home, put on my tie
Gonna get that girl that money will buy

38,Arthur Mcbride,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/good-as-i-been-to-you/arthur-mcbride.html,bob_dylan,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
Mark know what followed and what did betide
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day bein' pleasant and charming.
""Good morning, good morning,"" the sergeant he cried
""And the same to you gentleman,"" we did reply
Intending no harm but means to pa** by
For it bein' on Christmas morning
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning.
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strike
And he always lives pleasant and charmin'
And a soldier he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning"".
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
But you're dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning
And although that we're single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Althoug that your offers are charming.
""And we have no desire to take your advance



All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we could get shot without warning""
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant, ""I'll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning"".
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
""Now take them up, devils !"" cried Arthur McBride
""And temper their edge in the morning!"".
And the little wee drummer, we flattered his bow
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning.
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning.
Oh, me and my cousin, one Artur McBride
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it bein' on Christmas morning."

Saying, ""this land is condemned
All the way from new orleans
To jerusalem.""
I traveled through east texas
Where many martyrs fell
And i know no one can sing the blues
Like blind willie mctell
Well, i heard the hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like blind willie mctell
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
(and) see the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning



(i can) hear the undertaker's bell
(yeah), nobody can sing the blues
Like blind willie mctell
There's a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There's a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And i know no one can sing the blues
Like blind willie mctell
Well, god is in heaven
And we all want what's his
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
I'm gazing out the window
Of the st. james hotel
And i know no one can sing the blues
Like blind willie mctell

Farewell Angelina
The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
The music play slow
But farewell Angelina
The night is on fire
And I must go
[Verse 2]
There is no use in talking
And there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove
Ev'rything still is the same
A table stands empty
By the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina
The sky's changing colours
And I must leave
[Verse 3]
The jacks and the queens
They forsake the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina
The sky is folding
I'll see you after a while
[Verse 4]
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawed-off shotgun
And the corporals and neighbors



Clap and cheer with each blast
Farewell Angelina
The sky it is trembling
And I must leave fast
[Verse 5]
King Kong, little elves
In the rooftoops they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarra** anyone
Farewell Angelina
The sky is flooding over
And I must be gone
[Verse 6]
The camouflaged parrot
He flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about
Suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated
Perfect must die
Farewell Angelina
The sky's flooding over
And I must go where it is dry
[Verse 7]
Machine guns are roaring
Puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions
And at the faces of clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
But farewell Angelina
The sky is erupting
And I must go where it's quiet"

Ten thousand men on the move,
None of them doing nothin' that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Hey! Who could your lover be?



Let me eat off his head so you can really see!
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Standin' at my window wishing me goodnight.
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room,
Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room,
Spilling my bu*termilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!
Baby, thank you for my tea!
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me."
42,Disease Of Conceit,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/oh-mercy/disease-of-conceit.html,bob_dylan,"There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit
Comes right down the highway straight down the line
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind
Nothing about it that's sweet
The disease of conceit.
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit
Steps into your room eats into your soul
Over your senses you have no control
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit



Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count
From the outside world the pressure will mount
Turn you into a piece of meat
The disease of conceit.
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit
Give you delusions of grandeur and evil eye
Give you the idea that you're too good to die
Then they bury you from your head to your feet
From the disease of conceit."
43,d**h Is Not The End,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/down-in-the-groove/d**h-is-not-the-end.html,bob_dylan,"When you're sad and when you're lonely
And you haven't got a friend
Just remember that d**h is not the end
And all that you held sacred
Falls down and dows not bend
Just remember that d**h is not the end.
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that d**h is not the end.
When you're standing on the cross-roads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that d**h is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don't know what's up the bend
Just remember that d**h is not the end.
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that d**h is not the end.
When the storm clouds gather round you
And heavy rains descend



Just remember that d**h is not the end
And there's nowhere there to comfort you
With helping hand to lend
Just remember that d**h is not the end.
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that d**h is not the end.
Oh the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation
Shines in dark and empty skies
When the cities are on fire
When the burning flesh of men
Just remember that d**h is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one law abiding citizen
Just remember that d**h is not the end.
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that d**h is not the end."
44,Brownsville Girl,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/knocked-out-loaded/brownsville-girl.html,bob_dylan,"Well there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding across the desert and starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The town's people wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Well the Marshall now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
Turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his d**h.
Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
I can still see the day that you came to me on the pinked desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Well we drove that car all night 'til we got into San Anton'
And we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blow off.
Well we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times
when I was your only man
And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control.
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world.
Brownsville girl you're my honey love.Well we crossed the panthandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wrecking lot outside of
town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. She saw us
come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said ""Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while"".
Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming
a ride back to where she started
But she changed the subject every time money came up
She said ""Welcome to the land of the living dead"". You could tell she was
so broken-hearted
She said ""Even the swap meets around here are pretty corrupt"".
""How far are you all going ?"" Ruby asked us with a sigh
""We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn
Until the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies""
Ruby just smiled and said. ""Ah you know some babies never learn"".
Something about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head



But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking my way.
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world.
Brownsville girl you're my honey love.
Well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing the street when shots rang out
I didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran
We got him cornered in the churchyard ? I heard somebody shout.
Well you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said:
""A man with no alibi""
You went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trepa** but sometimes
you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now
You now I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Well I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeh but you know it's not the one I had in mind
He's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about
But I'll se him in anything so I'll stand in line.
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love.
You know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned
The only things we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name
wasn't Henry Porter
And you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too
good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind
in the French Quarter.
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who
are most content
I don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone
You always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most
convenient then they repent
And I always said. ""Hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on"".
There was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot
in the back
Seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down.
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love."
45,Dark Eyes,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/empire-burlesque/dark-eyes.html,bob_dylan,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and d**h are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.
A co*k is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.




They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and pa**ion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes."
46,Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/infidels/dont-fall-apart-on-me-tonight.html,bob_dylan,"Just a minute before you leave girl
Just a minute before you touch the door
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl ?
Do you think we can talk about it some more ?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Who've lost all ray of hope
You know, it ain't even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope.
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, yeah.
Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here, you can have my chair
I can't see us going anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there
I wish I'd have been a doctor
Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, yeah.
I ain't too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could, I'd bring bring you to the mountaintop, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel



But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
That's hanging in the Louvre
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can't move.
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, yeah.
Who are these people who are walking towards you
Do you know them or will there be a fight ?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right ?
Do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind ?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line.
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more b**by traps and bombs
No more decadence and charm
No more affection that's misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants ?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn't dance.
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, yeah."

You can play with fire but you'll get the bill
Don't let her know
Don't let her know that you love her
Don't be a fool, don't be blind
Heart of mine.
Heart of mine go back home
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam
Don't let her see
Don't let her see that you need her
Don't put yourself over the line
Heart of mine.
Heart of mine go back where you have been
It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in
Don't let her hear
Don't let her hear you want her



Don't let her hear know she's so fine
Heart of mine.
Heart of mine you know that she'll never be true
She'll only give to others the love that she's gotten from you
Don't let her know
Don't let her know where you're going
Don't untie the ties that bind
Heart of mine.
Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile
Don't let yourself fall
Don't let yourself stumble
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime
Heart of mine."
48,A Satisfied Mind,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/saved/a-satisfied-mind.html,bob_dylan,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I'd do things my way
Hmm, but little they know
Hmm, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Hmm, once I was wadding in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game
But suddenly it happened



Hmm, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my love ones
I'll leave there ain't no doubt
But one thing for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind."

50,Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/masterpieces/can-you-please-crawl-out-your-window.html,bob_dylan,"He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk



Or pick it up after he throws it.
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning.
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Baby, please stop crying
You know, I know the sun will always shine
So baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.

And I know what you're thinking of
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe
To see that you're madly in love.

52,Black Diamond Bay,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/desire/black-diamond-bay.html,bob_dylan,"Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her pa**port shows another face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay.
As the morning light breaks open the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
""Pardon monsieur"" the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
""Am I hearing you right ?""
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She pa**es him on the spiral staircase
Thinking he's the Sovjet Amba**ador
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches away
On Black Diamond Bay.
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the light blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
""Can you see anything ?""
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says ""Open up another deck""
But the dealer say ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous pl it""
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay.
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the woman's hand
Said, ""Here's a ring it cost a grand""
She said, ""That ain't enough""
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb



She pa**ed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do not disturb""
She knocked on it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay.
""I've got to talk to someone quick !""
But the Greek said, ""Go away"" and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, ""Help there's danger near
Please open op the door""
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said ""It happens every day""
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay.
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said ""It's too late now
You can take you money, but I don't know how
You'll spend it in the tomb""
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basemen blew
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tell her
""My darling je vous aime beacoup""
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay.
I was siting home alone one night in LA
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didn't seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And there's really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay."
53,Buckets Of Rain,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/blood-on-the-tracks/buckets-of-rain.html,bob_dylan,"Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets coming out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love honey baby
I can stand.
I been meek
And hard like and oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive friends will disappear
If you want me honey baby
I'll be there.
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your lips



I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me
Misery.
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I'm taking you with me honey baby
When I go.
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All ya can do is do what you must
You do what you must do and ya do it well
I'll do it for you honey baby
Can't you tell ?"

Go down old hannah, don'cha rise no more
Don't you rise up til judgment day's for sure
Ain't no more cane on the brazos



Its all been ground down to mola**es
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old shine
Well ya drove that bully til he went stone blind
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead

Neither have I wings that I could fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I
There is a ship and it sails on the sea
Loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim



I leaned my back up against an oak
Thinkin' it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me
Oh love is gentle, love is kind
Gay as a j**el when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like some morning dew"
56,Endless Highway,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/before-the-flood/endless-highway.html,bob_dylan,"J. r. robertson
Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,
Never let it slip away.
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray.
When ya get half cra-zy from the august heat
Or on a frozen, rotted road
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.
Chorus:
You're gonna walk that endless highway,
Walk that high-way till you die.
All you children goin' my way,
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.
When i see a detour up ahead,



Well, i leave it far behind,
Who knows what you're apt to find there.
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',
Well it look like t'me this time i wont be buyin'
Chorus
When they get a scapegoat by the throat,
It's hard labour and cold beans.
If ya get away real quick,
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.
Well, i sing by night, wander by day.
I'm on the road and it looks like i'm here to stay.

57,Dirge,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/planet-waves/dirge.html,bob_dylan,"I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down to suicide road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, whoever would have guessed
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit he's beaten 'til he's tame
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.



There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them
In this age of fibergla** I'm searching for a gem
The crystall ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet
I've paid the price of solitude but at least I'm out of debt.
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other's eyes 'till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make ?
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at
I hate myself for loving you but I should get over that."
58,A Fool Such As I,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/dylan/a-fool-such-as-i.html,bob_dylan,"Now and then there's a fool such as I

Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue
I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die.
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry



When you are gone, when you are gone, I will dream a little
I will dream as years go by
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
Now and then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I am a fool, yes, but I love you dear, I will love you dear
Till the day, till the day I die
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I."

Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door
[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door"

62,Billy 7,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/pat-garrett-and-billy-the-kid/billy-7.html,bob_dylan,"Spend the night with some sweet señorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead you
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber 



Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow
Spending the time that you borrow
Figuring a way to get back home"
63,All I Really Want To Do,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/bob-dylans-greatest-hits-vol-2/all-i-really-want-to-do.html,bob_dylan,"I ain't lookin' to compete with you,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Simplify you, cla**ify you,
Deny, defy or crucify you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
No, and i ain't lookin' to fight with you,
Frighten you or tighten you,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Chain you down or bring you down.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I ain't lookin' to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up,
an*lyze you, categorize you,
Finalize you or advertise you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't want to straight-face you,



Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Or define you or confine you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't want to meet your kin,
Make you spin or do you in,
Or select you or dissect you,
Or inspect you or reject you.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't want to fake you out,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me,
See like me or be like me.
All i really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

65,Day Of The Locusts,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/new-morning/day-of-the-locusts.html,bob_dylan,"Oh the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
The birdies were flying from tree to tree
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
And the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin'
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang their high whinning trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin'



The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me
Yeah,the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota
Sure was glad to get out of there alive
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
And the locusts sang with a high whinning trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me
Singing for me, well, singing for me."

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she was once a true love of mine.
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds.
Please see from me if her hair hanging down
If it curls and flows all down her breast



Please see from me if her hair hanging down
That's the way I remember her best.
Well, if you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say hello to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine.
If you're travelin' in the north country fair

69,Positively 4th Street,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/bob-dylans-greatest-hits/positively-4th-street.html,bob_dylan,"You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When i was down
You just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you gota helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning
You say i let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think i'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with
You see me on the street



You always act surprised
You say, ""how are you?"" ""good luck""
But you don't mean it
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it
No, i do not feel that good
When i see the heartbreaks you embrace
If i was a master thief
Perhaps i'd rob them
And now i know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you
Yes, i wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you

70,All Along the Watchtower,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/john-wesley-harding/all-along-the-watchtower.html,bob_dylan,"""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke 



But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl"
71,Absolutely Sweet Marie,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/blonde-on-blonde/absolutely-sweet-marie.html,bob_dylan,"Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie ?
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When you knew I had some other place to be
Now where are you tonight, sweet Marie ?
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were fin'ly delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest



I know you always say that you agree
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie ?
Well I don't know how it happened
But the river-boat captain he knows my fate
But ev'rybody else, even yourself
They're just gonna have to wait.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie ?
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wond'ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie ?"
72,Bob Dylan's 115th Dream,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/bringing-all-back-home/bob-dylans-115th-dream.html,bob_dylan,"I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have yuh understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline""
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they are far away at sea.
""I think I'll call it America""
I said as we hit the land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort
And start buying the place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throw us all in jail
For carryin' harpoons.
Ah me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Saying, ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line
Sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight.
I went into a restaurant
Lookin' for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some suzette, I said
""Could you please make that crepe""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boillin' fat
Food was flying anywhere
And I left without my had.
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again.
Well, I rapped upon a house
With the US flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way
"" The man says, ""Get out of here
I'll tear you limp from limb""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too""



He said, ""You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop""
I decided to have him arrested
And I went lookin for a cop.
I ran right outside
And I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, ""Fab""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was.
I repeated that my friends
Where all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, ""Call me if they die""
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
It just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line.
Well, by this time I was feed up
At tryin'g to make a stab
At bringin' back any help
For my friends and captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to the ship or back to jail
So I hooked my sailor suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship.
Well, I got back and took
The parkin' ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid.
Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships a-sailin'
There were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, ""Good luck""."

Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons
Ah, me, I busted out, don't even ask me how
I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around, saying, ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line saying, ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight
I went into a restaurant, lookin' for the cook
I told them I was the editor of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some suzette, I said, ""Could you please make that crepe?""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat
Food was flying everywhere, I left without my hat
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way""
The man says, ""Get out of here, I'll tear you limb from limb""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too."" He said, ""You're not Him



Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain't your pop""
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door, this Englishman said, ""Fab""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor, and the man asked me who I was
I repeated that my friends were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card, he said, ""Call me if they die""
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line
Well, by this time I was fed up at tryin' to make a stab
At bringin' back any help for my friends and Captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship
Well, I got back and took the parkin' ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past
They asked me my name and I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was when I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships a-sailin', they were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus. I just said, ""Good luck"""
74,From a Buick 6,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/highway-61-revisited/from-a-buick-6.html,bob_dylan,"I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids
But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge
And then she comes down a thruway, ready to sew me up with a thread
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed



Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed, c'mon
Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead
I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head
She brings me everything and more, and just like I said
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed"
75,Ballad In Plain D,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/another-side-of-bob-dylan/ballad-in-plain-d.html,bob_dylan,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken.
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Of the two sister, I loved the young
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her.
For her parasite sister, I had no respect
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To a sin of love's false security.
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies



Till the tombstones of damage read me no question but, ""Please
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter ?""
And so it did happen, like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces.
""The tragic figure"" her sister did shout
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out""
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between, the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
""How good, how good does it feel to be free ""?
And I answer them most mysteriously
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway""?"

77,Ballad Of Hollis Brown,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-times-they-are-a-changin/ballad-of-hollis-brown.html,bob_dylan,"Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin brokin' down.
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile.
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe.
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares ?
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pocket tell you
That you ain't a-got no friend.
Your babies are crying louder now
It's pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now



It's pounding on your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain.
Your gra** is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your gra** is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shels.
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shortgun
That's hangin' on the wall.
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shortgun
That you're holdin' in your hand.
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar.
There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born."
78,Bob Dylan's Blues,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/the-freewheelin-bob-dylan/bob-dylans-blues.html,bob_dylan,"Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are ridin' down the line
Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles
Ev'rybody's 'cept mine
Somebody musta tol' 'em
That I was doin' fine.
Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothin' in your heads
I got a real gal I'm lovin'
And Lord I'll be love her till I'm dead
Go away from my door and window too
Right now.
Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track
See no sports car run



I don't have no sports car
And I don't even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block.
Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don't step on me.
Well, look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes."
79,Fixin' To Die,https://lyrics.az/bob-dylan/bob-dylan/fixin-to-die.html,bob_dylan,"(first release
Feeling funny in my mind, lord,
I believe i'm fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind, lord
I believe i'm fixing to die
Well, i don't mind dying
But i hate to leave my children crying
Well, i look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, lord, when the sun goes down
Feeling funny in my eyes, lord,
I believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, lord
I believe i'm fixing to die



Well, i don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There's a black smoke rising, lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
And tell jesus make up my dying bed.
I'm walking kind of funny, lord
I believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Yes i'm walking kind of funny, lord
I believe i'm fixing to die
Fixing to die, fixing to die
Well, i don't mind dying
But i hate to leave my children crying.
