[Intro: Noreaga]
Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our sh**, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly sh**
You know what I'm sayin', some get high sh**
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy sh**, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that sh** he be doin'
[Hook: Slim Shady]
You ain't into f**in' d**, f** you
You don't do ecstasy, f** you
You don't pop mushrooms, f** you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, f** you
[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this sh**, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his a**
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em



I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
"Alright, Mr. Mathers, pick 'em up!"
No you pick 'em up! b**h, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this sh** no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office
[Hook: Slim Shady]
f*ggot, f** you, work at the post office, f** you
Talkin' sh** to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, f** you
If you're a f**in' dick, f** you
If you're a white rapper, f** you
Talk sh** about Stretch? You're cool
But if you don't talk sh** about Stretch, f** you
If you're a f**in' punk, f** you
Talk sh** about me, f** you
You wanna battle me, f** you
I ain't got to say sh** to you but f** you
