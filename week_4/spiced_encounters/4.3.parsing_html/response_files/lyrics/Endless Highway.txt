J. r. robertson
Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,
Never let it slip away.
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray.
When ya get half cra-zy from the august heat
Or on a frozen, rotted road
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.
Chorus:
You're gonna walk that endless highway,
Walk that high-way till you die.
All you children goin' my way,
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.
When i see a detour up ahead,



Well, i leave it far behind,
Who knows what you're apt to find there.
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',
Well it look like t'me this time i wont be buyin'
Chorus
When they get a scapegoat by the throat,
It's hard labour and cold beans.
If ya get away real quick,
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.
Well, i sing by night, wander by day.
I'm on the road and it looks like i'm here to stay.
Chorus
