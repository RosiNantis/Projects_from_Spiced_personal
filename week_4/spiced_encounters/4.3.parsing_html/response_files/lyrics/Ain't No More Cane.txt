Ain't no more cane on the brazos
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Its all been ground down to mola**es
Oh, oh- oh, oh- oh...
You shoulda been on the river in 1910
They were driving the women just like they drove the men.
Go down old hannah, don'cha rise no more
Don't you rise up til judgment day's for sure
Ain't no more cane on the brazos



Its all been ground down to mola**es
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old shine
Well ya drove that bully til he went stone blind
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead
Ain't no more cane on the brazos
Its all been ground down to mola**es.
