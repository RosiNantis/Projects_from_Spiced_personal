Paul, yo, um
So I got your message, I wish you would answer the f**in' phone
Um...
(Turn right)
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who f**in' says something f**ed up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like, what people are f**in' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo motherf**er, whatever the f** his name is, said I, literally said I rhymed "rhymes" with "chimes"



"s**er free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes"
(Turn right)
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire f**in' sentence you f**in' moron
(In 100 feet, turn left)
It's my fault 'cause you're f**in' stupid
But I swear to God this motherf**er lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his f**in' house right now
(Turn left)
I'll hit you back later
