Listen to me, baby
There's something you must see
I want to be with you, gal
If you wanna be with me
But if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
It ain't that I'm questionin' you
To take part in any quiz
It's just that I ain't got no watch
And you keep askin' me what time it is
So if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
I am just a poor boy, baby
Lookin' to connect
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
That I ain't got any respect
So if you got to go, it's all right



But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
You know I'd have a guilty conscience
And [Incomprehensible], too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do
So if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
It ain't that I'm wanting
Anything you never gave before
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon
It will be too dark for you to find the door
So you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
