[Intro: Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12 gauge shotty
And Ja said he should be
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me!
[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you motherf**ers want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 1: Eminem]
You ain't no k**er, you a p**y
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
b**hes wearing rags in photos, Ja's words being quoted
In The Source, stealing Pac's sh** like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to god hoping no one's listening
See 50 coming for me, Oh my god ma, my position
No one will pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feeling so invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a f**ing madman who screams
Like I'm Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Acting like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, f**ed from this sh**
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these d**, I'mma quit
Saying motherf**ers names before somebody f**s me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, f**er
[Hook]
Get off that E
Before you try to come and f** with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that b**h n***as is wasting
Institutionalized, my b**hes bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit motherf**er, we balling
Catch me counting trees and when I'm calling, can you set my call
CEO let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherf**ers thinking they can stop 50, they losing it
Lil' n***a named Ja think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies n***a, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet a** gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wondering why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talking b**h, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war sh** deeply
Done seen too many real n***as ball to let these b**h n***as beat me
Black, you's a motherf**ing punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scaring them f**ing kids with your ugly a** mug



And you can tell them n***as you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
n***a payback, Tah, I know your b**h a** from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don't play that
All these old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Irv looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to playa hate on my sh**, man eat a fat dick
Loving this sh** that's how you made me
Feeling like I got you n***as crazy
Against all odds, hoping my thug motherf**ers know
This be the realest sh** I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio getting blow
To the truest sh** I ever spoke
21 gun salute
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the f** you come involving me for
It's been a long time coming, like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even f**ing respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Running around talking sh** that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this co*ks**er whilst we handle you, n***a
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, n***a
Then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc roster
Dumb a**, now who's shooting?
Ah made you look
You said Bus singing the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shooting
I take a look at your man, the b**h shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob a** n***a start adjusting your plan
You let the streets down n***a, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little f*ggot desperate trying to re-establish a buzz
I know the sh** is driving you crazy, you wondering how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefing with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't trying to repeat this
JJust cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness
[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
It was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make sh** a public issue homie
And I'mma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
One
[50 Cent]
Hahaha, b*tch! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac, motherf**er, hahaha
2Pac shoes too big for you to walk in you lil' f*ggot, hahaha
(What do we have here now?)
