[Intro: eminem]
Welcome to detroit
This is the bet shady 2.0 cypher, 2011
Myself, slaughterhouse, and yelawolf
White dog, get em!
[Verse 1: yelawolf]
Put these mutha****as in a box and I send em away
Put em in a gray 'lac and pop the trunk
And throw em in the back, jack
Ha, dig em a grave
Put a brick inside that? when I put em in a page
Moving keys I can relate, cause I live in the cage
I throw up the a, I take em to school, I give them a grade
An easy e for effort, that's the wwa
White with an attitude, alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is z's they sleepin' on me, I can't get em awake
I spoon feed em? room full of deceivers
Believe I'm making it rain
Cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the vip like a potato
A bunch of meatheads, like **** it, I'll just feed em a cow
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper
You better pick up your heater
Cause even peter piper could pick up a mic
But what it's like to pick a fight with me is like putting nikes on a cheetah
I speed up, released in my? adidas
I'm out this ****, drinking sprite by the 2 liter
[Verse 2: joe budden]
Say I'm from the new school
I'mma say check your tone and watch your mouth
If they teaching how to dougie, then I'm condoning dropping out
Forced to wild, y'all birthed me then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hop's foster child
Now check it: don't blame y'all for being trash fans of coppin' it
Radio's the crime scene, the ma**es are the hostages
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fads was dodging it
I'm grown: I ain't watching the throne, I'm sabotaging it
You see that 4-headed monster in the storm looms
Snipe em from a distance: the scope got a long zoom
You super mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure over here, you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be about
I done took the wine out of amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats bout co*kin' a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I have this **** from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she doubt david is stern
She's so bad, I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the holiday inn, learned that from max b
That's why haters of envy, kind wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes like I was Benihanas
Is it me, or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?
Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical
My skin's thick, so the critics ignore it
So unafraid to die, you'd think I did it before
The boys robbin with the trash talk
Magic or Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphault with cat paws
Gla** jaw, hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no pa**port
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trap doors
If punks had award your status who*es categore
Probably be that of awards between michael rappaport and kenny latimore
I know hip hop's alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell
[Verse 3: crooked I]
I squad a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin
I caught him slippin', I gotta give a shot
I hit him with proper spittin
Hottest writtens and compositions
So competition's a contradiction, somebody mention they got a crooked
Holly? we probably different, got gotti henchmen
Opposition, I'll body quick as bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get richer
The sickest lyric kickin diggin a ditch
Weak lyricists get disfigured, sip liquor
Spit like a sick mixture of notorious, pun, and l
Get the big picture?
The poster, I'll roast ya
My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
It's over, control my whole coastal region like I'm supposed to
Flow is going postal even
Open season, heart close to freezin'
Ruthless is easy
Approach, I'm squeezin' ****a, believe me
Dopest west coaster breathin'
So most ya hope I'm vegan, nope I'm beefin
Rappers need to keep it trill
Give me a beat to k**, too many people still eatin' sleepin' pills
People sleepin' on my ether sk**s
Ay, y'all ain't even real
You bout to die in this cypher
Before you die, you should do the jada and leave a will
[Verse 4: joell ortiz]
I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this, I was moving crack
k**ers y'all become when y'all rhyme I salute and dap
And if I blink then remove your snaps
You ain't cool, you whack with your foolish act
Skinny jeans don't mean yo a** shoot, it means your booty claps



Don't play like tyler perry
This the slaughterhouse of pain
Flow brown, tight, and heavy
When it come to 16s, I'm a feign
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writing bars to Nas' Thief Theme. gettin my YAOWA on
Man, all these olajuwons, we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They feigning for us to break like beyonce's water
The four quarters doing all the eating
And ya'll gotta know why I made the cut, I'm puerto rican
Ortiz keep they fire ready
And trying to put me out's like trying to steal a transvestite from eddie
[Verse 5: royce da 5'9"]
I'm do or die dope and you can make the sticker sittin
On the door of that phantom, your suicide note
Hi rihanna... is nicki living with you?
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi rihanna... I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye rihanna... now back to y'all fools
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames, I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing about budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why I keep her, I say it's cheaper to
That's why I ride around in a rolls like wiz khalifa do
Rappers I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't k**, but your father will like jayden smith
I tell you like I tell my spanish chick
You fly, but I ain't going down on no landing strip
So get your wax on like daniel san
Or I'mma have to run like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive.
I head-shot him
Smack his girl on the bu*t and buy her some Red Bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber-s**ing with Jessica Alba, via Skype
I'm on my D-Boy/Deebo thing, spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with you b-roll bling.
Your flow is wack.
We cornered the market like a Walmart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah, this what 2 million albums sold, and an album that's gold
Look like without having to sell your soul
Nickle!
[Verse 6: eminem]
Wait, can I rap?
Lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal subliminal
In your swimming pool
You about to see peace destroyed
It'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your cd stores
Wanna stop it? you gon' need a priests, at least three swords
A "License to iLL" from the Beastie Boys, three Ouija boards
A squeegee and please be warned, don't ask what the squeegee's for
Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, do you see these horns?
And as for me you ask when I'm gone "will he be mourned?"
Is puke luke warm? should Casey Anthony do p**n?
Can that chick fit a new born dead baby inside a frickin' shoebox with a shoehorn,
smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on?
Can she duct tape and velcro a fetus?
Joell yo, tell Joe I need his empty box from his old shell-toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in the fetal position, they gettin' elbows to the penis
Yeah big deal
I took some little kids Big Wheel and spit in his firggin big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch me you wench, sit still
Did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz windsheild! ?
Is it dust we bout to kick up?
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his friggin' pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hill billy will til he gets hiccups! ?
Flippin' the script up like Mike Vick gettin' his junk bit by a pit,
Yup, I'mma sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician, cause I'll **** a trick up
Fix your lips up to say somethin' fly, or zip up
A. B, lets C, you said you were gonna do x-y-z
Till you **** around and get dropped like an "E"
When you add an i-n-g
Do put a "K" in front of that though, when I'm.C.
I'm not the king of the microphone boo, it's more like a phone booth
Superman in this ****, Kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power, I bump the Fat Boys
And eat rat poison, take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossin' a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit'll
Be like Nas doin' gospel or rn'b
you crazy?
Me pushin' them daises?
that thought is impossible
Is it flashin' across the news, "Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson, b**bs, and a monstrous tube of lube
And a bra, some boots, some panties, in a aqua blue Mazda
Swallowin' a popsicle, playing tonsil pool
So k** the rumors it ain't happenin',
I'ma rap till I'm fossil fuel
