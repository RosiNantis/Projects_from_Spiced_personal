[DRE]
Ya'll know me still the same ol' g
But i been low key
Hated on by most these n***as with no cheese, no deals and no g's
No wheels and no keys no boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me cause i can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But ya'll think i'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho please, you better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the o' g's
Eazy-e's ice cube's and d.o.c's and snoop d o double g's
And a group that said muthaf** the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
The bomb weed stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see
Ya'll better listen up closely
All you n***as that said that i turned pop
Or the firm flop, ya'll are the reason dre ain't been getting no sleep
So f** ya'll, all of ya'll
If ya'll don't like me, blow me
Ya'll are gonna keep f**in' around with me
And turn me back to the old me
[eminem](chorus x2)
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthaf**ers act like they forgot about dre
[eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of nwa.
One day i was walkin by
With a walkman on
When i caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot with his karl kani
I don't give a f** if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
But i'm drunk as f**
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage



Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
f** you too b**h call the cops
I'ma k** you and 'em loud a** muthaf**in barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still one found out right here
From here on out it's the chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And i'm still loco and nuts to choke you to d**h with a charleston chew
Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a mercedes benz with the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men ladies
Sorry doc but i been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's ok go with him hailey
(chorus) x2
[DRE]
If it was up to me
You muthaf**ers would stop comin' up to me
With your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last cd was out you weren't bumpin me
But now that i got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause i'm from the streets of
I told 'em all
All little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like i ain't got none
What you think i sold 'em all
Cause i stay well off
Now all i get is hate mail all day sayin' dre fell off
What, cause i been in the lab with a pen and a pad tryna get this damn label
Off
I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and f** rap you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that i was strapped with gats
When you were cuddled with cabbage patch
(chorus) x3
