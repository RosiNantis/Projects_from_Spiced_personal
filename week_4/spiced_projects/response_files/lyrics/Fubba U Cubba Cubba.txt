[Intro: x2]
I done figured this rap sh** out
I map sh** out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
sh** not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
Victims to stick I'm fixin to pick some and start sh**
I'm outta [repeat]
Pictures to rip and sh** to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, sh** Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to d**h, Benzino went deaf
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is p**y
Why the f** you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't sh** goin on, sh** I been gettin so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin some sh** to get you to go and hate me again



To tell the truth, I liked the sh** better then
sh** I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick sh** again, look
The game just isn't the same, it's changin
sh** Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin the same sh**
It's ancient, it's fakin
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
You think I'm the new ossama, press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
