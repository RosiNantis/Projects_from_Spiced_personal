Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherf**ing hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherf**ing hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you ga**ed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
1, 2, 3, and to the 4; 1 Pac, 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherf**ing MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a f**ing bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did f** my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, "f** the Free World!"



Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the f** I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dog, you embarra**ed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he shook
â€˜Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to d**h, he's scared to look in his f**ing yearbook; f** Cranbrook!
f** the beat, I'll go a cappella
f** a Papa Doc, f** a clock, f** a trailer; f** everybody!
f** y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of f**ing white trash, I say it proudly
And f** this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me
