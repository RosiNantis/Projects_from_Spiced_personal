When she said,
"don't waste your words, they're just lies,"
I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,
Then said, "what else you got left?"
It was then that i got up to leave
But she said, "don't forget,
Everybody must give something back
For something they get."
I stood there and hummed,
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
And she bu*toned her boot,
And straightened her suit,
Then she said, "don't get cute."
So i forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.
She threw me outside,
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.
And after finding i'd
Forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.



I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
And i tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against . . .
Her jamaican rum
And when she did come, i asked her for some.
She said, "no, dear."
I said, "your words aren't clear,
You'd better spit out your gum."
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor,
And i covered her up and then
Thought i'd go look through her drawer.
And, when i was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you.
And you, you took me in,
You loved me then
You didn't waste time.
And i, i never took much,
I never asked for your crutch.
Now don't ask for mine.
