Featuring Eminem and B Real
[ Eminem ]
WAAAHHHOOOOOO , hahaha (laughs)
guess who's back !?
mommy , we're home
say hello to my little friends , DJ Muggs , Soul Assa**ins , Cypress Hill
everybody , put your hands where my eyes can see
[ Eminem ]
everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as f** , forty fifty Samoans , they knowin' when D-Bo was
50 , Tweezy , Obie there won't be no hoe in us , they pop sh** like they gon' do sh** but no one does
from New York down to Texas , back up to Los Angeles , we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up gettin' rushed by too many to handle us , it's funny I guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched , it's not like we're just feelin' ourselves that much
it's just , that if someone ever does put us in the clutch , we just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
cause first of all you're p**y and everybody can see that , you f** around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in , we ain't even gon' be in it , no one's gonna hear nothin , no one's gonna see this sh**
and they'll be in and up out of it , them boys is bout it , bout it , the noise from (???) be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be layin' on the ground gettin' trampled by people dancin' , till the club closes and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened , nobody saw it happen , all cause your jaws are flappin'
and you couldn't stop yappin' and took it past rappin' , it ain't about the music no more , it's about tryin' to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off
[Chorus - Eminem]
sh**'s about to change , cause we ain't playin' no games
we ain't budgin' neither are they , we ain't sayin' no names
sh** just ain't the same , when the K's get to scream
hip hop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hip hop , cause those days are gone
it ain't about tryin rip shots , to get props no more



it's about tryin' not to get popped , and get dropped to the floor
cause hip hop is in a state of 911
[B-Real]
step off my holster cause sh** it's gettin' serious , all these d** you be f**in' with make you delirious
thinkin' you coming with heat , yo son I'm curious , how long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us ?
some people can never fade us , that make us so furious , mistake us for fakers , homie we great but glorious
we livin' for real and others just makin' the stories up , allusions are broken , so live it up , you corny f**s
if you take a f**in' minute to think about what you've done , when you stood against the gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one , sprayin' you b**hes till there is none , i'm like a rolling stone homie , I got you under my thumb
you silly little b**hes can end up right up in ditches , we cut you and give you stitches , for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget , you're clockin' a small digit , dealin' with the Giant Goliath , people that's how we live it , c'mon
[Chorus]
[Ganxsta Ridd]
uh , gangsta gangsta who come to pay you a visit , on this sh** you call hip hop , this function is where did it
when I put it in motion , my focus is gettin' branded , my appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
got you stumblin' for cover , this music dyin' in numbers , but you wouldn't pause and wonder , admittin it's all glamour
when you enter the business you thinkin' you runnin sh** , you witness that funny sh** , your b**hes they ain't sh**
we gangstas we blast first , ask questions later , all these imitators parading like they some playaz
tryin' to save hip hop the task is somethin greater , cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught , I'm not tellin' , or more like k**in' not caring , i'm ridin' a gangsta feelin' , no fearing when gangstas dyin'
I'm in a full circle with homies that supposed to bleed , on an 8 mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s
[Chorus]
