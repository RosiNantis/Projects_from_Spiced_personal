0,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date



Hearts full of pa**ion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by",bob_dylan
1,"They say every man must need protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd



Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released",bob_dylan
2,"All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all
All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all
Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek



Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say ""No, no""
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all",bob_dylan
3,"Bye and bye
I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
Well, I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye
On you I'm casting my eye
I'm paintin' the town
Swinging my partner around
Well, I know who I can depend on
I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads, I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town
Making my last go-round
Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin'
And I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even acquainted with my
Own desires
I'm rollin' slow



I'm doing all I know
I'm tellin' myself
I found true happiness
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow, goin' where the wild roses grow
Well the future
For me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love
And you will be my last
Papa gone mad, mamma, she's feeling sad
Mamma, she's feeling sad
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be",bob_dylan
4,"Well, she's got jet pilot eyes from her hips on down.
All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town.
She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.



She got all the downtown boys, all at her command
But you've got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman
She's a man.

And rattle your walls

Well, Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right

She through her arms around him and she began to cry

There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand

He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run
He pierced her in the heart the lifeblood did flow
Deep in her grave Pretty Polly did go
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
With nobody there but the wild birds to moan
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
A debt to the devil Willie must pay

Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold

The summer kisses

Old winter's song

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away

But I ain't neither one

Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing through another no good town

The streets
Are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joys



But friends when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls
And little boys May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear

May have brought you
Some stars for your shoes But Santa only brought me
The blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered

You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' we can call our own
Well, I'm movin' after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' but the moon and stars



Down every street there's a window
And every window's made of gla**
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothin'

20,"I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream
Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream
Somethin' came up out of the sea
Swept through the land of the rich and the free
I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then I ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet
Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide
The foe has crossed over from the other side
They tip their caps from the top of the hill
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill
Along the dim Atlantic line
The ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avengin' God
The world is old, the world is gray
Lessons of life can't be learned in a day
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand
To the music that comes from a far better land
Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend
k**ed outright he was, by his own men
It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year



I feel that the unknown world is so near
Pride will vanish and glory will rot
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot
The bells of the evening have rung
There's blasphemy on every tongue
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light
And that I was loyal to truth and to right
Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn
In the deep green gra**es of the blood stained wood
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood
Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost
The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost
A letter to mother came today
Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed
But he'll never be better, he's already dead
I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away
In an ancient light that is not of day
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell",bob_dylan

Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard



And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred

The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine
I was pa**ing by yon cool crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind
Ain't talking, just walking
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burning, still yearning
No one on earth would ever know
They say prayer has the power to heal
So pray for me, mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I am trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't going well
Ain't talking, just walking
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burning, still yearning
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
Now I'm all worn down by weeping
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
Ain't talking, just walking
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking through the cities of the plague.
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down
Ain't talking, just walking
Eating hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.
Heart burning, still yearning
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every waking moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour 



I'll revenge my father's d**h then I'll step back
Ain't talking, just walking
Hand me down my walking cane.
Heart burning, still yearning
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.
All my loyal and my much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
Ain't talking, just walking
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.
Heart burning, still yearning
Thinking about that girl I left behind.
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dying
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?
Ain't talking, just walking
Carrying a dead man's shield
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking with an ache in my heel
The suffering is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears
Ain't talking, just walking
Walking ever since the other night.
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking until I'm clean out of sight.
As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone
Ain't talking, just walking
Up the road, around the bend.
Heart burning, still yearning
In the last outback at the world's end.

24,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales



For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chaineded an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",bob_dylan
25,"I can't understand, she let go of my hand
An' left me here facing the wall
I'd sure like to know, why she did go
But I can't get close to her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here
She acts like we never met It's all new to me like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it's hard to think on that she's the same one
That last night I was with From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk
'Stead of acting like we never met If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt, she seems too far out
For me to return to her chase Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played



Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed for she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess
To anything I might've tried
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide Though the night ran swirling an' whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to, I can be just like you

If you wanna be with me
But if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
It ain't that I'm questionin' you
To take part in any quiz
It's just that I ain't got no watch
And you keep askin' me what time it is
So if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
I am just a poor boy, baby
Lookin' to connect
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
That I ain't got any respect
So if you got to go, it's all right



But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
You know I'd have a guilty conscience
And [Incomprehensible], too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do
So if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
It ain't that I'm wanting
Anything you never gave before
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon
It will be too dark for you to find the door
So you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night",bob_dylan
27,"I can hear the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain
Oh, something's a-telling me i wear the ball and chain.
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He's always off somewhere when i need him most.
The spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin' me i love ya still.
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, i begin to swoon.
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore i finally disappear?
Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.
But me, i can't cover what i am
Wherever the children go i'll follow them.
I march in the parade of liberty



But as long as i love you i'm not free.
How long must i suffer such abuse
Won't you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose?
I've given up the game, i've got to leave,
The pot of gold is only make-believe.
The treasure can't be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me i love ya but you're strange.
One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it.

One, two, a-one two three
In the lonely night
In the shadows of a pale moonlight
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams.
I walk alone through the shakin' street,
I'm a-listenin' to my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time.
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Not this time, i'll have no more of this.
It's much too cruel, it's much too cool, way too revealing.
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma,



Oh babe, how you left me reelin' with this feelin'.
Up on the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I held you close and got what i deserve
Where we were born in time.
You pressed me once, pressed me twice,
You hang the flame, but you'll pay the price.
Oh babe, and that fire is still smokin'.
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, lord and you were plain,
Oh babe, truer words have never been spoken or broken.
In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what's left of me,
Where we were born in time.

""don't waste your words, they're just lies,""
I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,
Then said, ""what else you got left?""
It was then that i got up to leave
But she said, ""don't forget,
Everybody must give something back
For something they get.""
I stood there and hummed,
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
And she bu*toned her boot,
And straightened her suit,
Then she said, ""don't get cute.""
So i forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.
She threw me outside,
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.
And after finding i'd
Forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.



I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
And i tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against . . .
Her jamaican rum
And when she did come, i asked her for some.
She said, ""no, dear.""
I said, ""your words aren't clear,
You'd better spit out your gum.""
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor,
And i covered her up and then
Thought i'd go look through her drawer.
And, when i was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you.
And you, you took me in,
You loved me then
You didn't waste time.
And i, i never took much,
I never asked for your crutch.
Now don't ask for mine.

As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
Mark know what followed and what did betide
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day bein' pleasant and charming.
""Good morning, good morning,"" the sergeant he cried
""And the same to you gentleman,"" we did reply
Intending no harm but means to pa** by
For it bein' on Christmas morning
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning.
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strike
And he always lives pleasant and charmin'
And a soldier he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning"".
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
But you're dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning
And although that we're single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Althoug that your offers are charming.
""And we have no desire to take your advance



All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we could get shot without warning""
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant, ""I'll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning"".
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
""Now take them up, devils !"" cried Arthur McBride
""And temper their edge in the morning!"".
And the little wee drummer, we flattered his bow
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning.
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning.

We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wrecking lot outside of
town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. She saw us
come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said ""Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while"".
Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming
a ride back to where she started
But she changed the subject every time money came up
She said ""Welcome to the land of the living dead"". You could tell she was
so broken-hearted
She said ""Even the swap meets around here are pretty corrupt"".
""How far are you all going ?"" Ruby asked us with a sigh
""We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn
Until the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies""
Ruby just smiled and said. ""Ah you know some babies never learn"".
Something about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head

I didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran
We got him cornered in the churchyard ? I heard somebody shout.
Well you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said:
""A man with no alibi""
You went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trepa** but sometimes
you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now
You now I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Well I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeh but you know it's not the one I had in mind
He's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about
But I'll se him in anything so I'll stand in line.
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love.
You know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned
The only things we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name
wasn't Henry Porter
And you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too
good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind
in the French Quarter.
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who
are most content
I don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone
You always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most
convenient then they repent
And I always said. ""Hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on"".
There was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot
in the back
Seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down.

45,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and d**h are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.
A co*k is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.




They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and pa**ion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.",bob_dylan

Sit down here, you can have my chair
I can't see us going anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there

Maybe I'd have done some good in the world

That's hanging in the Louvre
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can't move.
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, yeah.
Who are these people who are walking towards you
Do you know them or will there be a fight ?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right ?
Do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind ?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line.
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more b**by traps and bombs
No more decadence and charm
No more affection that's misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants ?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn't dance.

Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk



Or pick it up after he throws it.
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised

52,"Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her pa**port shows another face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay.
As the morning light breaks open the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
""Pardon monsieur"" the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
""Am I hearing you right ?""
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She pa**es him on the spiral staircase
Thinking he's the Sovjet Amba**ador
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches away
On Black Diamond Bay.
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the light blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
""Can you see anything ?""
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says ""Open up another deck""
But the dealer say ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous pl it""
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay.
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the woman's hand
Said, ""Here's a ring it cost a grand""
She said, ""That ain't enough""
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb



She pa**ed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do not disturb""
She knocked on it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay.
""I've got to talk to someone quick !""
But the Greek said, ""Go away"" and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, ""Help there's danger near
Please open op the door""
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said ""It happens every day""
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay.
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said ""It's too late now
You can take you money, but I don't know how
You'll spend it in the tomb""
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basemen blew
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tell her
""My darling je vous aime beacoup""
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay.
I was siting home alone one night in LA
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didn't seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And there's really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway

You were just a painted face on a trip down to suicide road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, whoever would have guessed
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit he's beaten 'til he's tame
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.



There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them
In this age of fibergla** I'm searching for a gem
The crystall ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet
I've paid the price of solitude but at least I'm out of debt.
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other's eyes 'till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make ?

72,"I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have yuh understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline""
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they are far away at sea.
""I think I'll call it America""
I said as we hit the land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort
And start buying the place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throw us all in jail
For carryin' harpoons.
Ah me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Saying, ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line
Sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight.
I went into a restaurant
Lookin' for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some suzette, I said
""Could you please make that crepe""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boillin' fat
Food was flying anywhere
And I left without my had.
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again.
Well, I rapped upon a house
With the US flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way
"" The man says, ""Get out of here
I'll tear you limp from limb""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too""



He said, ""You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop""
I decided to have him arrested
And I went lookin for a cop.
I ran right outside
And I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, ""Fab""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was.
I repeated that my friends
Where all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, ""Call me if they die""
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
It just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line.
Well, by this time I was feed up
At tryin'g to make a stab
At bringin' back any help
For my friends and captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to the ship or back to jail
So I hooked my sailor suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship.
Well, I got back and took
The parkin' ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid.
Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships a-sailin'
There were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus

75,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken.
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Of the two sister, I loved the young
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her.
For her parasite sister, I had no respect
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To a sin of love's false security.
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies



Till the tombstones of damage read me no question but, ""Please
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter ?""
And so it did happen, like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces.
""The tragic figure"" her sister did shout
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out""
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between, the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
""How good, how good does it feel to be free ""?

I got a real gal I'm lovin'
And Lord I'll be love her till I'm dead
Go away from my door and window too
Right now.
Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track
See no sports car run



I don't have no sports car
And I don't even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block.
Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don't step on me.
Well, look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right

Way before my baby daughter Hailey,
I was hara**ed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey.
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes,
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers.
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin',
And had me in the position to beat me into submission.



He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose,
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat.
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe.
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honky!""
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me.
I made them think they beat me to d**h,
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left.
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth.
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws.
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools.
""This is for every time you took my orange juice,
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good.
I co*ked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could,
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood.
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot.
Made it home later that same day.
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray.
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read.
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed.
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, d**??
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"" (Stop!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control,
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull.
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look b**h, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"" ""Shut up you c*nt!""
I said, ""f** it!"" took it and stuck it back up in my head,
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck.

Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screaming, ""f** safe s**!""
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
It's in you to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket, with a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy a**es in the backseat
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me
Dead pa**enger in the pa**enger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic
And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge k**er of bin syllable binge
Fill a syringe, till I
Draw first blood
Even pop sh** on my pop sh**, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Tortured a, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious f**er
The rock cuts into rock cause who would have thought
This much of a co*ks**er that go across the bu*tocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unrevealing quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeves' spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I had to come back on these f*ggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a f**ing Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplating rubbing sh** in your face till I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had f**ing careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, you puss
And thighs are squooshed
What kind of attires that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track

And now it's my fault my fault

I went to john's rave with ron and dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from houston
Who love booze and alternative music (whattup?)
Told me she was starvin, i said it wasn't a problem (nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage

Come on sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door??	pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? wasn't it yours? nuh uh

I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin, i don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase you and spank you with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said,
[g] help me i think i'm havin a seisure!



I said, ""you're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!""
""would you put it down you're startin to scare me""
She said,
[g] i'm twenty-six years old and i'm not married
I don't even have any kids and i can't cook
(hello!) i'm over here sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause i never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate

I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find dave he majored in allergies
""john, where's dave at before i bash you?""
[j] he's in the bathroom; i think he's takin a crap dude!
""dave! pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
Choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of spring break, how long do these things take to wear off?""

Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives""

Anyone who comes up must go down.

Better not let up, better not let them breathe.
Last shot give it all you got.
Try to turn me down b**h get f**ed with the volume nob,
f** all you snobs.
Hoes I hope all you rot.
Two bottles of luburdom and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
And you wanna minaj a trois, you twots?
f** that I'd rather turn this club to a ballroom brawl.
Get as rowdy as Routhlisberger in a bathroom stall.
Like a leaf stuck in a vacuum ya'll ain't nothtin but a whole lot of s**in' goin' on in rap.
Yeah but I'm home.
Bad to the bone, back in the zone
Let him alone,
You don't wanna go eggin' him on.
It'll never be my chair that you're on.
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen.

When I die so does hip hop.

You f*gs ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top.
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone, like I'm in the twilight dog get off my bone this is my mic doggone it I like hogging it.
Flow so wet I'ma take this beat tobogganin.
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it.
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it.
Suplexin it on cement, like I'm on some straight outta compton sh**
Take this dick and chomp on it.



I'm so bad I can b**h slap a back handed compliment.
Jacka** eat a donkey dick.
The game I just about conquered, it like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers b**h, I'm the king of this honkey sh**, I reign supreme in this honkey sh**.
No sense screaming and arguing.
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in.
You think you ball, well I palm it.
I throw up bombs when I vomit.
Boy I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelet.
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic.
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze.
b**h I'm as bat sh** as Ozzy, it's obvious, you can tell I go right off the bat.
No pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head.
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web, I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage.
I catch a fly in that b**h.
You think you fly, you just food.
I give as much of a flying f** as that superman dude.
Guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and bamboozled, confused as usual, and you can get ripped she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat, or stay the f** outta hell's kitchen
I came to co*k block like a square f**ing male chicken.

Aiyo, this next song is
Dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget
About you, you f**in' h*mo
We still remember
There once was a man
Who liked to jump around
(Jump around)
But he got too old to jump up and down
(Up and down)
(So then what happened?)
So he put the mic down
And picked the guitar up
(Picked the guitar up)
(And then he what?)
Started singin' the blues
Like there's no tomorrow
(No tomorrow, come on)
Left his boys in the house of pain
(The house of pain)
It was the wisest decision he ever made
(Ever made)
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
I remember back when you had
The Knack
(Had the knack)
And I remember when you had
Your first heart attack
(Heart attack)
I was right there laughin'
When I heard the news
(Heard the news)
I just wish the cardiac
Would'a murdered you
(Would'a murdered you)
Maybe Ice-T's right
You are a b**h
(You are a b**h)
You come around when you're broke
And you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
Remember back in '94, like right before
Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When house of pain was out of fame
Like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again



Or even further back, when I first had heard The Knack
And you were down with Syndicate
I went to get your sh**, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the sh**
Now you sound ridiculous you dick less piece of sh**,
How could you diss me, b**h?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech
When I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin', then you left the room
And didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you was mad that someone else was
White and tried to rhyme or somethin'
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin' to steal your light or nothin'
But you're a h*mos**ual, white rappin' Irish f*got
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a f*got too
Then I'd be confused as you
And I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you?
I never f**ed with you
Why would you f** with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you
What, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you
And I don't f**in' sing
And probably play guitar better
And I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, sh** you was me in '92
So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you
And maybe that will help me know
What it's like to sing the blues
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago

And by the way, a three-eighty's a f**in' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a f**in' real gun
You little b**h

My f**in' name in a song
Don't be subliminal about it

Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your a**
Before I write your sh**, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my b**h a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther

We came to monopolize the game, illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit f**ing the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
sh**, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, f** a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

Guard your j**els and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool

Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay co*king the round
I sh** logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
sh**, they think I'm Illuminati, so f**ing ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-a** pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying

In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on fire
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone
But don't compare me
I'm better off jus' left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin wreckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherf**er Ja musta lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along and fight you
Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you
k**in' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that sh** you on
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this sh** too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads wit any motherf**er that wants to
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'ma grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow,
another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on

And put six thru your hats of seven 3/8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night

They see me more pop a boy for icey cuz I could
Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood
b**h when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared b**hes

Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open free, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay s**er free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...
(Eminem)
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
Thats why the f** I remain s**er free to this day
The game will never be the same



No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing....
(Outlawz)
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the j**elry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
Thats when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I can't win so I'm inviting some help
And every now and then I take rights from left
Im still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
No matter how much I try (stay alive)
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my a** cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop k**ers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin...
(2Pac)
...One day at a time. Damn!",eminem
17,"Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Was because you denied seeing me
Now I'm pissed off
Sit back, homie, relax
In fact grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts
Yeah Dre, sick track
Perfect way to get back
Wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat
That's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now
Oh gee, is that supposed to be me
In the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
b**h, shut the f** up before I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wild-n-out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out
You probably think cuz it's been so long
If i had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session
Down and sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the f** I do
Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too
f*ggot, you think I'm scared of you?
You gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some s*ut, b**h-c*nt
That made me put up with her psycho-a** over 6 months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky?
Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you f**ing had to be drunk to f** me?
Second base? What the f** you tell Nick, punk?
In the second week we were dry humping
That's gotta count for something
Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about
How I nutted early, 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling?
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarra**ing me
I'm embarra**ing you, and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as the song's getting airplay, I'm dissing you



I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued
I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
This is 34 bars, we ain't even a third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you. Mariah who?
Oh, did I say ""who*e"", Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time for no reason
Girl you out ya alcholic mind
Check ya wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I f**in' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this sh** is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But f** it now I'm bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
I ain't saying this sh** again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot before I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every f**ing thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot
Slim Shady, Slim Shady, I love you
I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say?
It's nothing
Yeah, so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said, ""I want you""
Now should I keep going, or should we call truce?
You think you cute, right?
You bet your sweet a** I do
I'm Mary Poppins, B
And I'm Superman, mmm
Mary P., Slim Shady
Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my baby girl
Then I'll still be your superhero
Oh my, Em
Yeah, I'm right here
You like this
Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a knife when I tell you get a life
But I'm movin' on with mine
Nick, is that your wife?
Well tell her to shut her mouth, then I'll leave her alone
If she don't stick to the script, then I'mma just keep goin'
Damn
I see Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying, ""Cut the tape, cut the tape""

20,"[Verse 1:]
I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An a**hole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my sh** list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would k** him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping sh**, but since when did this many
People ever give a sh** but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That's like telling Gwen Stefan' that she sold out
Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down
In history think they know now
Because everybody knows
[Hook - Skylar Grey:]
Everybody knows that you're just an a**hole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
""Oh, everyone knows""
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an a**hole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
[Verse 2:]
Thanks for the support, a**hole [*scratch*] thanks for the support, a**hole
Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your a** socked in the mouth
Lay'em off it
But what the f** is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knock me down, I went down from the counter
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the f**ing pants off me
To take my belt, word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little sh** what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock



Just to go out watch Batman
Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo
My soul's escaping through this a**hole that is gaping
A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I'm not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating cause everybody knows
[Hook]
[Verse 3:]
Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinking we have some magnetic pull
Then scream ""ICP in this b**h! How do f**ing magnets work!?""
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, It's tragical
Thinking some magical sh**'s gonna happen? That ain't practical
You cracking a joke, it's laughable, cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
b**h you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded.
Thinking you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna, hunt me down like a dog, cause you're on my a**
But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother trying
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it further
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherf**ing father time
And it ain't never gonna stop. A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime, so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half-empty gla** in a cup, so now my cup has runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherf**ing coaster
I'm going back to what got me here, yeah co*ky, and can't knock being Rudolph so fear not my deer, and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward and weird, if you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too. You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows.",eminem

Welcome to detroit
This is the bet shady 2.0 cypher, 2011
Myself, slaughterhouse, and yelawolf
White dog, get em!
[Verse 1: yelawolf]
Put these mutha****as in a box and I send em away
Put em in a gray 'lac and pop the trunk
And throw em in the back, jack
Ha, dig em a grave
Put a brick inside that? when I put em in a page
Moving keys I can relate, cause I live in the cage
I throw up the a, I take em to school, I give them a grade
An easy e for effort, that's the wwa
White with an attitude, alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is z's they sleepin' on me, I can't get em awake
I spoon feed em? room full of deceivers
Believe I'm making it rain
Cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the vip like a potato
A bunch of meatheads, like **** it, I'll just feed em a cow
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper
You better pick up your heater
Cause even peter piper could pick up a mic
But what it's like to pick a fight with me is like putting nikes on a cheetah
I speed up, released in my? adidas
I'm out this ****, drinking sprite by the 2 liter
[Verse 2: joe budden]
Say I'm from the new school
I'mma say check your tone and watch your mouth
If they teaching how to dougie, then I'm condoning dropping out
Forced to wild, y'all birthed me then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hop's foster child
Now check it: don't blame y'all for being trash fans of coppin' it
Radio's the crime scene, the ma**es are the hostages
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fads was dodging it
I'm grown: I ain't watching the throne, I'm sabotaging it
You see that 4-headed monster in the storm looms
Snipe em from a distance: the scope got a long zoom
You super mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure over here, you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be about
I done took the wine out of amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats bout co*kin' a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I have this **** from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she doubt david is stern
She's so bad, I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the holiday inn, learned that from max b
That's why haters of envy, kind wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes like I was Benihanas
Is it me, or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?
Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical
My skin's thick, so the critics ignore it
So unafraid to die, you'd think I did it before
The boys robbin with the trash talk
Magic or Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphault with cat paws
Gla** jaw, hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no pa**port
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trap doors
If punks had award your status who*es categore
Probably be that of awards between michael rappaport and kenny latimore
I know hip hop's alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell
[Verse 3: crooked I]
I squad a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin
I caught him slippin', I gotta give a shot
I hit him with proper spittin
Hottest writtens and compositions
So competition's a contradiction, somebody mention they got a crooked
Holly? we probably different, got gotti henchmen
Opposition, I'll body quick as bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get richer
The sickest lyric kickin diggin a ditch
Weak lyricists get disfigured, sip liquor
Spit like a sick mixture of notorious, pun, and l
Get the big picture?
The poster, I'll roast ya
My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
It's over, control my whole coastal region like I'm supposed to
Flow is going postal even
Open season, heart close to freezin'
Ruthless is easy
Approach, I'm squeezin' ****a, believe me
Dopest west coaster breathin'
So most ya hope I'm vegan, nope I'm beefin
Rappers need to keep it trill
Give me a beat to k**, too many people still eatin' sleepin' pills
People sleepin' on my ether sk**s
Ay, y'all ain't even real
You bout to die in this cypher
Before you die, you should do the jada and leave a will
[Verse 4: joell ortiz]
I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this, I was moving crack
k**ers y'all become when y'all rhyme I salute and dap
And if I blink then remove your snaps
You ain't cool, you whack with your foolish act
Skinny jeans don't mean yo a** shoot, it means your booty claps



Don't play like tyler perry
This the slaughterhouse of pain
Flow brown, tight, and heavy
When it come to 16s, I'm a feign
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writing bars to Nas' Thief Theme. gettin my YAOWA on
Man, all these olajuwons, we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They feigning for us to break like beyonce's water
The four quarters doing all the eating
And ya'll gotta know why I made the cut, I'm puerto rican
Ortiz keep they fire ready
And trying to put me out's like trying to steal a transvestite from eddie

On the door of that phantom, your suicide note
Hi rihanna... is nicki living with you?
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi rihanna... I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye rihanna... now back to y'all fools
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames, I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing about budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why I keep her, I say it's cheaper to
That's why I ride around in a rolls like wiz khalifa do
Rappers I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't k**, but your father will like jayden smith
I tell you like I tell my spanish chick
You fly, but I ain't going down on no landing strip
So get your wax on like daniel san
Or I'mma have to run like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive.
I head-shot him
Smack his girl on the bu*t and buy her some Red Bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber-s**ing with Jessica Alba, via Skype
I'm on my D-Boy/Deebo thing, spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with you b-roll bling.
Your flow is wack.
We cornered the market like a Walmart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah, this what 2 million albums sold, and an album that's gold
Look like without having to sell your soul
Nickle!

Wait, can I rap?
Lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal subliminal
In your swimming pool
You about to see peace destroyed
It'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your cd stores
Wanna stop it? you gon' need a priests, at least three swords
A ""License to iLL"" from the Beastie Boys, three Ouija boards
A squeegee and please be warned, don't ask what the squeegee's for
Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, do you see these horns?
And as for me you ask when I'm gone ""will he be mourned?""
Is puke luke warm? should Casey Anthony do p**n?
Can that chick fit a new born dead baby inside a frickin' shoebox with a shoehorn,
smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on?
Can she duct tape and velcro a fetus?
Joell yo, tell Joe I need his empty box from his old shell-toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in the fetal position, they gettin' elbows to the penis
Yeah big deal
I took some little kids Big Wheel and spit in his firggin big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch me you wench, sit still
Did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz windsheild! ?
Is it dust we bout to kick up?
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his friggin' pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hill billy will til he gets hiccups! ?
Flippin' the script up like Mike Vick gettin' his junk bit by a pit,
Yup, I'mma sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician, cause I'll **** a trick up
Fix your lips up to say somethin' fly, or zip up
A. B, lets C, you said you were gonna do x-y-z
Till you **** around and get dropped like an ""E""
When you add an i-n-g
Do put a ""K"" in front of that though, when I'm.C.
I'm not the king of the microphone boo, it's more like a phone booth
Superman in this ****, Kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power, I bump the Fat Boys
And eat rat poison, take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossin' a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit'll
Be like Nas doin' gospel or rn'b
you crazy?
Me pushin' them daises?
that thought is impossible
Is it flashin' across the news, ""Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson, b**bs, and a monstrous tube of lube
And a bra, some boots, some panties, in a aqua blue Mazda
Swallowin' a popsicle, playing tonsil pool

Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a b**h?
You f**in' keyed up my Benz
b**h, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a b**h
I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You f**in' retard, I'll have you s**in' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the f** do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I f**in' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV?
Turn around and use it on me
You tryna snort on my keys?
You f**in' broad, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me,
Tell your momma I'ma drop you off at the hospital later
We finna make this run
Take this gun and cover me, Slater
And quit your...

In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night skies
Like shooting stars
I can really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (Dreamin', I'm fallin, dreamin', I'm fallin') Lets pretend like its 98, like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now lets pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (OK)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big a** stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Lets try to use imagination [Chorus] OK, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had a dream of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my cla**es
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now lets pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre



Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes [Chorus] (And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream, but those days are gone they're just memories) Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it,
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward but as strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as sh-t
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as sh**
F-ck a talent show in the gymnasium b**h
You won't amount to sh-t quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this sh-t
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C sh**
Cause he never risked sh-t he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap he ain't even here he pretends that [Chorus]",eminem

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
[Verse 1]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this b**h had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life
I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain, b**h, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it: I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I f**ing get repaid?
Look at how I dress: f**ing baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to f**ing step
And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your f**ing breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I f**ing left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's
[Hook]



[Verse 2]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same sh** that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish b**h
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to sh**
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
f** you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, b**h and it's just...

[Verse 1]
You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the morning and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible
Right there's the coroner, waiting for you to
Turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run, all you want is to rest
'Cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to k** you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin
While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's, with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, sh**
Guess I must've just blacked out again—not again!
[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some b**bs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana, then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle, and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to



Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them
[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and

She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack, my last Vic and a half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's a**
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, ""I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun.""
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdlin' screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret pa**ageway 'round here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause…

It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'

I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'

Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts

Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills

Carca**es of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
Hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Well f** it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe



After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummagin
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want to skin
Been, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win
Severin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb
Pull the lever then, trapdoor, d**h is evident

Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin so chill
f**in who*e you better f**in hold still
Make sure none of that, lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffin those girls
Man I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her then I'll wait, I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I f**in told you!
I keep hearin voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her while you put ya shish-kabob skewers
Into her, barbecue her or would you do to her
What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?

Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!""

Resist and the biscut will exceed the distance
And bounce off one's home

WAAAHHHOOOOOO , hahaha (laughs)
guess who's back !?
mommy , we're home
say hello to my little friends , DJ Muggs , Soul Assa**ins , Cypress Hill
everybody , put your hands where my eyes can see
[ Eminem ]
everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as f** , forty fifty Samoans , they knowin' when D-Bo was
50 , Tweezy , Obie there won't be no hoe in us , they pop sh** like they gon' do sh** but no one does
from New York down to Texas , back up to Los Angeles , we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up gettin' rushed by too many to handle us , it's funny I guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched , it's not like we're just feelin' ourselves that much
it's just , that if someone ever does put us in the clutch , we just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
cause first of all you're p**y and everybody can see that , you f** around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in , we ain't even gon' be in it , no one's gonna hear nothin , no one's gonna see this sh**
and they'll be in and up out of it , them boys is bout it , bout it , the noise from (???) be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be layin' on the ground gettin' trampled by people dancin' , till the club closes and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened , nobody saw it happen , all cause your jaws are flappin'
and you couldn't stop yappin' and took it past rappin' , it ain't about the music no more , it's about tryin' to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off
[Chorus - Eminem]
sh**'s about to change , cause we ain't playin' no games
we ain't budgin' neither are they , we ain't sayin' no names
sh** just ain't the same , when the K's get to scream
hip hop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hip hop , cause those days are gone
it ain't about tryin rip shots , to get props no more



it's about tryin' not to get popped , and get dropped to the floor
cause hip hop is in a state of 911
[B-Real]
step off my holster cause sh** it's gettin' serious , all these d** you be f**in' with make you delirious
thinkin' you coming with heat , yo son I'm curious , how long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us ?
some people can never fade us , that make us so furious , mistake us for fakers , homie we great but glorious
we livin' for real and others just makin' the stories up , allusions are broken , so live it up , you corny f**s
if you take a f**in' minute to think about what you've done , when you stood against the gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one , sprayin' you b**hes till there is none , i'm like a rolling stone homie , I got you under my thumb
you silly little b**hes can end up right up in ditches , we cut you and give you stitches , for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget , you're clockin' a small digit , dealin' with the Giant Goliath , people that's how we live it , c'mon
[Chorus]
[Ganxsta Ridd]
uh , gangsta gangsta who come to pay you a visit , on this sh** you call hip hop , this function is where did it
when I put it in motion , my focus is gettin' branded , my appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
got you stumblin' for cover , this music dyin' in numbers , but you wouldn't pause and wonder , admittin it's all glamour
when you enter the business you thinkin' you runnin sh** , you witness that funny sh** , your b**hes they ain't sh**
we gangstas we blast first , ask questions later , all these imitators parading like they some playaz
tryin' to save hip hop the task is somethin greater , cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught , I'm not tellin' , or more like k**in' not caring , i'm ridin' a gangsta feelin' , no fearing when gangstas dyin'
I'm in a full circle with homies that supposed to bleed , on an 8 mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

Relax and take notes, while i take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherf**er say your prayers
Hail mary full of grace.. smack the b**h in the face;
Take her gucci bag and the north face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, i just want the paper
The visa, kapeesha? i'm out like, ""the vapors""
Who's the one you call mr. macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like camacho, i got so
Much style i should be down wit the stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} n***az need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then f** your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember sh**! just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
s**in on the tits! had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess i was a combination of house of pain and bobby brown
I was ""humpin around"" and ""jump-in around""
Jacked her then i asked her who's the man; she said, ""b-i-g""

Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, i'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, i hit 'em with the tech g
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly



I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she s**ed the dick, i stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to f** him from the back
But smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; f**ed him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is f**in feelin it!
Hardcore, i got it s**ed like a p**y
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me

I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherf**ing kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' a** in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My f*ggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just f**in' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest sh** I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have k**ed 'em, sh**, I woulda shot Kim and him both 



It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
b**hin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and sh**'s missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
b**h do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish b**h, I hope you f**ing burn in hell for this sh**
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

Ya'll know me still the same ol' g
But i been low key
Hated on by most these n***as with no cheese, no deals and no g's
No wheels and no keys no boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me cause i can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But ya'll think i'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho please, you better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the o' g's
Eazy-e's ice cube's and d.o.c's and snoop d o double g's
And a group that said muthaf** the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
The bomb weed stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see
Ya'll better listen up closely
All you n***as that said that i turned pop
Or the firm flop, ya'll are the reason dre ain't been getting no sleep
So f** ya'll, all of ya'll
If ya'll don't like me, blow me
Ya'll are gonna keep f**in' around with me

But nothin comes out when they move they lips

Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of nwa.

With a walkman on
When i caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot with his karl kani
I don't give a f** if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
But i'm drunk as f**
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage



Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
f** you too b**h call the cops
I'ma k** you and 'em loud a** muthaf**in barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still one found out right here
From here on out it's the chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And i'm still loco and nuts to choke you to d**h with a charleston chew
Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a mercedes benz with the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men ladies
Sorry doc but i been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's ok go with him hailey

Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause i'm from the streets of

Verse 1
sometimes I just feel like, quittin,
I still might, why do I put up this fight, why do I still write,
sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life,
sometimes I just wanna jump on stage and just k** mic's,
and show these people what my level of sk**'s like,
but I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life,
something ain't right, hit the brake lights,
case of this stage fright, draw on the plane flight
call but I might fall,
it aint my fault crying eye balls'
my insides crawl and I clam up,
I just slam shut, I just can't do it,
my whole man-hoods, just been stripped,
I've just been picked so I must then get on the bus then split,
man f** this sh**, yo I'm going the f** home,
world on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road...
CHORUS
I'm a man, I'm a make a new plan,
time for me to just stand up and travel new land,
time to leave and just take matters into my own hands,
once i'm over these track man i'm a never look back,
and i'm gone and I know right where i'm goin,
sorry momma i'm grown, I must travel alone,
aint no followin footsteps, i'm making my own,
only way that I know how to escape from, 8 mile road...
Verse 2
Walking these train tracks trying to regain back,
the spirit I have before I go back to the same crap,
to the same plant, in the same pants,
trying to chase rap, gotta move a.s.a.p,
gotta get a new plan, momma's gotta new man,
poor little baby sister, she dont understand,
sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad,
and just colours until the crayon get dull in her hand,
while she just colours her big brother and mother and dad
there's no telling what really goes on in her little head,
wish that I could be the daddy that neither one of us had,
but I keep running from something I never wanted so bad,
sometimes I get upset, cause I aint blew up yet,
its like I grew up but I aint grown two nuts yet,
dont got a rep, my step, dont got enough pep,
the pressures too much man i'm just trying to do what's best,
and I try, sit alone and I cry, yo I wont tell her why,
not a moment goes by that I look right at the sky,
please i'm begging you god,
please dont let me be fishin holding no regular job,
yo I hope you will be getting home, whereva you are,
yo i'm telling you dog, i'm bailing this trailer tomorrow,
tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye,
say whenever you need me baby, i'm never too far,



but yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know,
and i'm a be back for you the second that I blow,
on everything I own, i'll make it on my own,
off to work I go, back to this 8 mile road...

Verse 3
You got to live it to feel it, you didn't then you wouldn't get it,
well see what the big deal is, why wasn't and still is,
to be walking this borderline of Detroit city limits,
its different in it, a certain significant of certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see but its everything to me,
its my credibility, you never seen, heard, smelt a meda ta MC,
who's incredible on the same pedestal as me,
the chaque still unsigned, having a rough time,
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes,
go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line,
but when it comes crunch time, where do my punch lines go,
who must I show, to bust my flow, where must I go, who must I know,
or am I just another grab in the bucket
cause I aint having no luck with this little rappers so f** it
maybe I need a new outlet, I'm starting to doubt sh**,
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with,
I look like a bum, yo my clothes aint about sh**,
at the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit,
and its cold trying to travel this road,
plus I feel like i'm always stuck in this battleing mode,
my defenses are so up one thing dont want it pity from no one,
this city is no fun, there is no sun and its so dark,
sometimes I just feel like, i'm being pulled a-part,
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends,
its enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin,
sometimes I just feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not,
what i'm doing I just blow my head is a stove top,
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot,
sometimes my mouth just overloads with acid, I dont got,
but I learned its time for me to U-Turn,
yo it only takes one time for me to get burned,
aint no callin her next time I need a new girl,
I can no longer play stupid or be immature,
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage,
like I already got the beat all I need is the word,
uh uh got the urge, suddenly its a surge,
suddenly a new burst of energy hits the curve,
time to show these free world leaders, three and the third,
I am no longer scared now, i'm free as a bird,
then I turn and cross over the medium curve,
hit the burbs and run and see its a blur, this 8 mile road...

They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now
Let's get down to business



I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can sh** be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't f**in' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
So there you have it folks
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullsh** does not pay
Because
Marshall!
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall!
So until next time friends
Same blond hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall!

Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple (hurry up!)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the b**h won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, ""I'm ready now b**h - ain't you feelin these kicks c*nt?""
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than s**m cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!)
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can s** my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to k** it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is f**in crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- do you hear me?
Is f**in crazy
[Eminem]
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a f*g in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium



than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if I keep on k**in my girlfriends
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is f**in crazy -- listen!!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- you hear me?
Is f**in crazy
[Eminem]
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
""Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been""
""It's probably AIDS!"" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dil*os
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady sh** that's on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn!

[em](aight)
[eminem] guess what? i ain't coming in yet...
I'll come in a minute
[eminem] ayo...this is my love song...it goes like this
[eminem]
Back when mark walhberg was marky mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the, sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre-diction is you're gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinning
You're beginin' to think women
Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guiness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap b**hes
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up
[em's spaceman voice]earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Look at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And i'm so high that i might die if i go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so
Chorus
[eminem]
'cause every time i go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but i gotta stay
These d** really got ahold of me
'cause every time i try to tell them ""no""
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a s**a all i gotta say
These d** really got ahold of me
[eminem]
In third grade, all i used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
17 years later i'm as rude as jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest b**bs
I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So i don't need game to play
I just say whatever i want to whoever i want
Whenever i want, wherever i want, however i want
However, i do show some respect to few
As ecstacy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as f** spillin' guts to you



We just met
But i think i'm in love with you
But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like ""yo, what the f** we do?""
I gotta go b**h
You know i have stuff to do
'cause if i get caught cheatin' then i'm stuck with you
But in the long run
These d** are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But f** it, i'm on one
So let's enjoy
Let the x destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
sh**'s sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
sh**, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more
Chorus
[eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wollow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'cause none of the sh** is going to mean sh** where we're going
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like sh** every morning
But you're young
You've got a lot of d** to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
s**s to be you
If i could take it all back now, i wouldn't
I would have did more sh** that people said that i shouldn't
But i'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better d** and updated
But i've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done i'll be 40
Before i know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysiting for haley while haley's out getting smashed
Chorus 2x (same as previous, but 2nd time
The last line is repeated like this)
Drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me
'cause d** really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this sh**, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his a**
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em



I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
""Alright, Mr. Mathers, pick 'em up!""
No you pick 'em up! b**h, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this sh** no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office
[Hook: Slim Shady]
f*ggot, f** you, work at the post office, f** you
Talkin' sh** to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, f** you
If you're a f**in' dick, f** you
If you're a white rapper, f** you
Talk sh** about Stretch? You're cool
But if you don't talk sh** about Stretch, f** you
If you're a f**in' punk, f** you
Talk sh** about me, f** you
You wanna battle me, f** you

45,"[Verse 1:]
Came to the world at a time when in was in need of a villain
An a**hole, that role think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speakin to children
Everything was happenin' so fast it was like I blinked, sold 3 million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man I coulda' stacked my sh** list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really
Thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would k** him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' sh** but since when did this many
People ever give a sh** what I had to say it's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin' put a dick in your rear-end
That's why every time you mention a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battled for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed atta-boy
They told me to slow down, I'd just zone-out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blopde, it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
'Cause I was tryin to leave No Doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now
Because everybody knows
[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]
Everybody knows, that you're just an a**hole
Everywhere that you go, people want to go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide, you are just an a**hole
Everyone knows, everyone knows Thanks for the support, a**hole [x2]
[Verse 2:]
Quit actin' salty, I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well God damn honky that compliment's like back-handin' a donkey, good way to get your a** socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him, but what the f**'s all this trash talking about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
I went down for the count, I fell but the fans caught me and now
You're gonna have to beat the f**in' pants off me to take my belt
Word to Pacquiao, momma said there ain't nothin else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin'
Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'till your bullet riddled, but you should give little sh** what I think
This whole world is a mess, gotta have a goddamn



Vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs ta test a testicles? Not that man
Half you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
Water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo my soul's escaping through this a**hole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper
But I'm takin' no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole and I'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go, tryin' to dip out the back door retreating
'Cause everybody knows
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
Holy mackerel. I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth I smacked a girl
Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed ""ICP in this b**h! how do f**in' magnets work? '
'Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable, hate to be dramatical but I'm not romantical
L'm makin' up words, so you can understandable
It's tragical, thinkin' some magical sh**'s gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin'
A joke? It's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded
Full body armor b**h, you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a trainwreck, I gotta one track mind and shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49'er
'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner
Been tryin' ta hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my a** but you can't get a cent
'Cause all of my spare time's spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther, so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been parent I'll never grow up, so to Hell with your parents and 'mother' f** 'father' time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half-empty gla** in a cup now my cup has runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a muthaf**in' coaster
L'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah co*ky and
Can't knock bein' Rudolph, so fear not my deer
And dry up your tear drops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock be
Cause everybody knows

A lotta people ask me stupid f**ing questions
A lotta people think that what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna k** somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well sh**, if you believe that, then I'll k** you
You know why? Cause I'm a criminal
[Hook]
I'm a criminal! Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take sh** from no one
[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a f*g or lez
Or the h*mos**, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate f*gs? the answer's ""yes""
h*mophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherf**in' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!



And I was just checking the mail, get it? Checking the 'male'?""
How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
""Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these f**in' retards
And to think, it's just little old me
Mr. Don't Give a f** still won't leave

Round and round
But i wish it would stop, and let me off right now
Yes man
As the world turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience

I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
And light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
Cuz we're dope as f** and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool,takin a sh** in a warm pool
They threw me out the ramada inn
I said it wasn't me, i got a twin (oh my god its you! not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cuz i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors
Cla** clown freshman, dressed like les nessman
f** the next lesson, i'll past the test guessin
And all the other kids said eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only cla** he'll pa** is phys ed
May be true, till i told this b**h in gym cla**
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed slim fast (who me?)
Yeah b**h you so big you walked into big tanny's and stepped on jenny craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then i thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin (rarrrr!)
It began storming, i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that b**h by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While i drop this b**h face down and watch her belly flop

As the world turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day

We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as f** and only get a 2 in the source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and i'm still tryna nail a trailor park b**h
I met a s*ut and said ""what up, its nice to meet ya""
I'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza



But i'm broke as f** and i don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, i was bout to roll this next blunt
But i aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus i'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin funny
Cuz you know your stinkin a** is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun
Thats when her a** put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the gla** doors
Started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god i was smokin crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All i wanted to do was rape the b**h and snatch her purse
Now i wanna k** her
But so i gotta catch her first
Ran through rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her f**in porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced s*ut
Looked around the room
Thats when i seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there b**h! i got my gun co*ked!
You might as well come out now
She said ""come in, its unlocked!""
I walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay p**n
She said ""come her big boy, lets get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg ""no, please let go""
But she swallowed my f**in leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now i'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then i remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick!
Whipped that sh** out, and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted ""now b**h, lets see who gets the best!""
Stuffed that sh** in crooked and f**ed that fat s*ut to d**h (ahh!! ahhh!)
Come here b**h!
Come here!
Take this motherf**in dick!
b**h, come here!

Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)

Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothing
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinking
It's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things
And if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch ï¿½ it don't hurt
Her was eating dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?
[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
[Verse 2]
See, honey: there's a place called heaven and a place called hell, a place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
ï¿½Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout



Sit back in your chair, honey, quit trying to climb out!
I told you it's okay Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter
[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (Mama!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee! (woosh!)
There goes Mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with Dad, no more restraining order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!)

51,"[Verse 1]
(Aight, aight...Uh...Slim Shady...Yo, yo, yo...)
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella into mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eating a four course meal, watching you starve to d**h
With an IV in your veins, feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of d**
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the a**es ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
As a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'M STILL ALIVE!""
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp, and
Pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start sh**
Got your b**h wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with
Motherf**er, Slim Shady b**h! Recognize!
[Verse 2]
Met a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the f**ing head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
f** an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers
We blowin' up your house, k**ing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats



I'm doin' drive-by's in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack
Today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strappin' more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Comin' together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherf**er!
[Verse 3]
(Like this, like that, like this
Like this, like that, like this)
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a f**ed up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And ain't sh** changed
I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of d**h
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
sh**, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
f** it, you only live once, you might as well die now
[Verse 4]
Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming ""GET HIM!""
I grabbed one, lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next f*ggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen
(Damn... damn... damn...)",eminem
52,"[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, uh haydi ellerinizi havaya kaldırın
Ve alkışlayın
İleri geri çünkü
Bu basit bir şey değil
Bu biraderler Dirty Dozen'ı temsil ediyor
Be F-R-O çift G'yim
Ve adamıma bakın
Adı şey ımm, ee
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, beyin ölümü gerçekleşmiş Jim Brady gibidir
Ben bi' M-80'im, sen ise bücürsün Lil Kim' gibi
Haykırıyorum, Dirty Dozen
Yaramaz, küfürbaz bir kafiye ustasıdır
Siz oyunculara Marty Schottenheimer'dan daha pis söverim
Stilini kopyaladığın gavattan daha berbatsın
Çift CD'li albüm yapsan iki kopya bile satamazsın
Kabul et bunu sonra siktir et, hazır konusu açılmışken
Uyuşturucu alırım, patlarım ve sağlam tüttürürüm
Benim adım Marshall Mathers, ben alkoliğin tekiyim (Merhaba, Marshall!)
Bir rahatsızlığım var ama teşhis koyamıyorlar
Cüzdanını saklasan iyi edersin
Çünkü seni gasp etmek için yaklaşıyorum
Bir bilet aldım konserine ve sildim onunla kıçımı
Kaşar, geliyorum seni sopalamaya, o kadar hızlı döveceğim ki gözlerin görmeye yetişemeyecek
Mike Tyson gibi nakavt edeceğim
Kanıt puding'in içindedir, istersen DeShaun Holton'a sor
Ron Goldman'den daha fena seni doğrayacağım
[Nakarat]
O yüzden beni iki tane Glockla görürsen
2Pac gibi ""Dünyanın amına koyim"" diye bağırırken
Gram sikimde değil
Arkamdan atıp tutarsın
Arkadaşlarına benim müptezel olduğumu söylersin
Gram sikimde değil
Kasedimi tekrar koy rafa
Ve koş git arkadaşlarına kasedin boktan olduğunu söyle
Gram sikimde değil
Ama beni sokakta görürsen çöm yere
Çünkü hırpalanacaksın, vurulacaksın ve öldürüleceksin
Çünkü gram sikimde değil
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Pete'den daha hoşum, ama Miilkbone'u parçalamak için arayışlardayım
Ölümsüzüm, Vanilla Ice'ı silikon gibi eritirim
Sana ortada bir şey yokken dissleyecek kadar problemliyim
Havanın -20 derece olduğu kış gününden daha soğuğum



Baharatsız bir tadım
Gizli bir gösterimim
Derginize lafı veririştiririm ve yine de kötü eleştiri yapamazsınız
Kancığını terkettiririm
Folgers kristallerini koklatırım
Bu lirikal bir savaş, beyler; kuşanın silahlarınızı
Voltron gibi oluşur, seni omuz füzelerimle uçururum
Slim Shady, Eminem o eski adımdı (bye bye!)
Gasp ederim, kokain çekerim, kürtajı desteklerim
Patolojik yalancıyım, boyumdan büyük işlere kalkışırım
Yalnızım, budalayım, kendimim, arada sırada gözükürüm
Düşünmeden hareket ederim, içtikçe içerim, müptezelim
Yarı hayvan, yarı insanım
Ölünü atıyorum bedenin bir afgan dantelinden
Daha delikli haldeyken bir çöp konteynerına
[Nakarat]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Biri beni bu limuzinden çıkarsın, kafese sıkışmış bir iblisim
Sahnede Rage Against the Machine gibi haykırıyorum
Zalim olduğuma kendimi ikna ettim, bu kayıt devam ederken uyuşturucu alıyorum
Klinik açıdan beynim ölü, ikinci bir seçeneğe ihtiyacım yok
Bırak mücehveri direk kutsal hazineyi ortaya koyarım
Senin stilini çalacağım, sadece daha iyi yapmak için
Baskıya dayanamıyorum, kaşarlardan bıktım
Bulaşıkları yıkarken dırdır eden patronlardan da bıktım
Okulda ise pek fazla laf yapmazdım
Çünkü kafam bi' milyon olmakla meşguldü
Çok koşuşturduğum için suratım kızarmaktan bir hal oldu
Son Jim Beam içtim, o zaman yüzüm grileşti
8. sınıfta spor salonuna gittim, kadın yüzme takımına tecavüz ettim
Şaka yapıyorum sanma ben komedyen değilim
Çok fazla akli sorunlarım olduğu çin bu beni kokain çekmeye ve tüttürmeye itti
Kaldırımın üzerinden de giderim, toprak yolda da
Sonunda eve ulaştım ama içeri girmek için anahtarım yok

53,"[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Eminem:] Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no n***a f** with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (b**h)
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your a** to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that sh** down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your sh** to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your a** crack
And blast that sh** to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullsh** and flow



Yo, you need to come with the real sk**s, and act like you know
[Chorus: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know sh** so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your a** forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your f**ing memory
It's either them or me man, k** or be k**ed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his a** sh**ty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And f** Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack
[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these sk**s you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become",eminem
