Someone hit me from behind,bob_dylan
Before she sleeps in the sand?,bob_dylan
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,bob_dylan
But I can't get close to her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime,bob_dylan

My clothes are hangin' out,bob_dylan
Well I'll do anything in this God-almighty world,bob_dylan
And keep your eyes wide,bob_dylan

[Verse 2],bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
I've got the Christmas blues When somebody wants you,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
The ravaged land lies for miles behind,bob_dylan
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',bob_dylan
"Ain't talking, just walking",bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
"Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened",bob_dylan
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?,bob_dylan
Or else you gotta stay all night,bob_dylan
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.,bob_dylan
"You came, you saw, just like the law",bob_dylan
"Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin'",bob_dylan

Go lightly on the ground.,bob_dylan
"Then she said, ""don't get cute.""",bob_dylan
On a bottle of wine,bob_dylan
"Girls like birds, flyin' away",bob_dylan
That only you could see?,bob_dylan
"Thieving in the alley,",bob_dylan
"Said, ""Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while ?""",bob_dylan
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist,bob_dylan
Can strut their feathers well,bob_dylan
There is nothing to prove,bob_dylan
Hey! Who could your lover be?,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
Just remember that d**h is not the end.,bob_dylan
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels,bob_dylan
"They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is",bob_dylan
"And I need you, yeah.",bob_dylan
It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in,bob_dylan
"Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out",bob_dylan
"I'll do right to you, too.",bob_dylan
If he needs a third eye he just grows it,bob_dylan
"Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying",bob_dylan
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write,bob_dylan
And your fingertips,bob_dylan
"Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old shine",bob_dylan
But first it bent and then it broke,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan

Spending the time that you borrow,bob_dylan
"Shock or knock or lock you up,",bob_dylan

"Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody",bob_dylan
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold,bob_dylan

She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead,bob_dylan
"Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect",bob_dylan
rat-faced,bob_dylan
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve,bob_dylan
See no sports car run,bob_dylan
I believe i'm fixing to die,bob_dylan
"Hearts full of pa**ion, jealousy, and hate",bob_dylan
Calling out that he's been framed,bob_dylan
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall,bob_dylan
And I'm walkin' on briars,bob_dylan
[Verse 3],bob_dylan
If you just let me follow you down,bob_dylan
The chance won't come again,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
Old winter's song,bob_dylan
You smiling through the fence at me,bob_dylan
"Well, I've been lookin' all over",bob_dylan

"Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today",bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
Somebody needs you,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad,bob_dylan
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,bob_dylan
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross,bob_dylan

"Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake",bob_dylan
"Without any doubt, she seems too far out",bob_dylan

"You married young, just like your ma,",bob_dylan
And I'm walkin' on briars,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
"I'm not the one you want, babe,",bob_dylan
So i forced my hands in my pockets,bob_dylan
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat,bob_dylan
When I'm gone you will remember my name,bob_dylan
Seen a shooting star tonight,bob_dylan
Fighting every inch of the way.,bob_dylan
"No, no babe, I got blood in my eyes for you",bob_dylan
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,bob_dylan
But nobody can sing the blues,bob_dylan
Ev'rything still is the same,bob_dylan

,bob_dylan
"Not the end, not the end",bob_dylan
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet,bob_dylan
"But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized",bob_dylan
"Come over here from over there, girl",bob_dylan
Don't let her hear,bob_dylan
My friends and my love ones,bob_dylan
Ya got to do unto others,bob_dylan
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,bob_dylan
"Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying",bob_dylan
"""Pardon monsieur"" the desk clerk says",bob_dylan

"Oh, the locusts sang their high whinning trill",bob_dylan
If you'll only let your hair hang low.,bob_dylan
If you'll only let your hair hang low.,bob_dylan
That's the way I remember her best.,bob_dylan
You had no faith to lose,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
"But to live outside the law, you must be honest",bob_dylan
I said as we hit the land,bob_dylan
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,bob_dylan
"Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed, c'mon",bob_dylan
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect,bob_dylan
gravestoned,bob_dylan
Your baby's eyes look crazy,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
Woman needs man and man must have his mate,bob_dylan
I see my light come shining,bob_dylan
And if I fell under the spell of your call,bob_dylan
I'm not even acquainted with my,bob_dylan
San Francisco is fine,bob_dylan
"Yes, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world",bob_dylan
And don't speak too soon,bob_dylan
He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run,bob_dylan
But I miss you most of all,bob_dylan
Just like you always smiled before,bob_dylan

"When did you leave Heave, angel mine?",bob_dylan
"Babe, I'd run circles all around",bob_dylan

Christmas is a joy of joys,bob_dylan
Down every street there's a window,bob_dylan
All must yield to the avengin' God,bob_dylan
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,bob_dylan
"Heart burning, still yearning",bob_dylan
And pretend that he just doesn't see?,bob_dylan
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing,bob_dylan
For me to return to her chase Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played,bob_dylan
Lookin' to connect,bob_dylan
Wherever the children go i'll follow them.,bob_dylan
,bob_dylan

And I thought of me,bob_dylan
Trying to be tender,bob_dylan

And drink the king's health in the morning.,bob_dylan
Like blind willie mctell,bob_dylan
A table stands empty,bob_dylan

"Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.",bob_dylan
"Well, if you're traveling in the north country fair",bob_dylan
And you know it,bob_dylan
"But you and I, we've been through that",bob_dylan
,bob_dylan
I took a deep breath,bob_dylan
"Where people carried signs around, saying, ""Ban the bums""",bob_dylan
"Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead",bob_dylan
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.,bob_dylan

Come a-running down your stairs,bob_dylan

And every window's made of gla**,bob_dylan
"The world is old, the world is gray",bob_dylan
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,bob_dylan
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost,bob_dylan
"The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind",bob_dylan
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail,bob_dylan
