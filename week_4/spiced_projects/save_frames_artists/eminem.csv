Paul, yo, um
So I got your message, I wish you would answer the f**in' phone
Um...
(Turn right)
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who f**in' says something f**ed up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like, what people are f**in' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo motherf**er, whatever the f** his name is, said I, literally said I rhymed ""rhymes"" with ""chimes""



""s**er free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes""
(Turn right)
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire f**in' sentence you f**in' moron
(In 100 feet, turn left)
It's my fault 'cause you're f**in' stupid
But I swear to God this motherf**er lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his f**in' house right now

I'll hit you back later"

Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherf**ing hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherf**ing hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you ga**ed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
1, 2, 3, and to the 4; 1 Pac, 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherf**ing MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a f**ing bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did f** my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, ""f** the Free World!""



Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the f** I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dog, you embarra**ed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he shook
‘Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to d**h, he's scared to look in his f**ing yearbook; f** Cranbrook!
f** the beat, I'll go a cappella
f** a Papa Doc, f** a clock, f** a trailer; f** everybody!
f** y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of f**ing white trash, I say it proudly
And f** this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me"

Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12 gauge shotty
And Ja said he should be
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me!
[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you motherf**ers want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 1: Eminem]
You ain't no k**er, you a p**y
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
b**hes wearing rags in photos, Ja's words being quoted
In The Source, stealing Pac's sh** like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to god hoping no one's listening
See 50 coming for me, Oh my god ma, my position
No one will pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feeling so invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a f**ing madman who screams
Like I'm Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Acting like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, f**ed from this sh**
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these d**, I'mma quit
Saying motherf**ers names before somebody f**s me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, f**er

Get off that E
Before you try to come and f** with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked

Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that b**h n***as is wasting
Institutionalized, my b**hes bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit motherf**er, we balling
Catch me counting trees and when I'm calling, can you set my call
CEO let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherf**ers thinking they can stop 50, they losing it
Lil' n***a named Ja think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies n***a, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet a** gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wondering why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talking b**h, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war sh** deeply
Done seen too many real n***as ball to let these b**h n***as beat me
Black, you's a motherf**ing punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scaring them f**ing kids with your ugly a** mug



And you can tell them n***as you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
n***a payback, Tah, I know your b**h a** from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don't play that
All these old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Irv looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to playa hate on my sh**, man eat a fat dick
Loving this sh** that's how you made me
Feeling like I got you n***as crazy
Against all odds, hoping my thug motherf**ers know
This be the realest sh** I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio getting blow
To the truest sh** I ever spoke
21 gun salute
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the f** you come involving me for
It's been a long time coming, like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even f**ing respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Running around talking sh** that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this co*ks**er whilst we handle you, n***a
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, n***a
Then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc roster
Dumb a**, now who's shooting?
Ah made you look
You said Bus singing the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shooting
I take a look at your man, the b**h shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob a** n***a start adjusting your plan
You let the streets down n***a, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little f*ggot desperate trying to re-establish a buzz
I know the sh** is driving you crazy, you wondering how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefing with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't trying to repeat this
JJust cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

It was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make sh** a public issue homie
And I'mma return back to my regular self
And have fun again

""He's convulsing!""
""Oh my"" ""We're gonna have to shock him!""
""Oh my God!"" ""We're gonna have to shock him!""
""Oh my God!""
These are the results of a thousand electric volts,
A neck with bolts ""Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse!""
A kid who refused to respect adults,
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose.
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery,
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me.
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack.
My first day in junior high, this kid said,
""Just you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die""
I looked at my watch it was one twenty,
""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first.
Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst!
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!""
""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know, my leg, it hurts!""
""Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?""
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!""
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over.
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework.""
""But don't you want to give me after school detention?""
""Nah, that bully wants to beat your a** and I'm a let him""
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage
Way before my baby daughter Hailey,
I was hara**ed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey.
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes,
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers.
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin',
And had me in the position to beat me into submission.



He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose,
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat.
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe.
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honky!""
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me.
I made them think they beat me to d**h,
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left.
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth.
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws.
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools.
""This is for every time you took my orange juice,
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good.
I co*ked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could,
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood.
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot.
Made it home later that same day.
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray.
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read.
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed.
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, d**??
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"" (Stop!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control,
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull.
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look b**h, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"" ""Shut up you c*nt!""
I said, ""f** it!"" took it and stuck it back up in my head,
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck.
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage
It' brain damage, I got brain damage
It's brain damage,
It's probably brain damage."

The results of much too many d** what you're seeing
I'm a mindf**, completely dis-(gu-uh-uh)-sting
I'm (what), a human mutt f** a being I'm a dog
f** lambs, I'm silencing 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walking, talking, Ouija board
Speaking in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norrf
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some sh** yo,
""Is this some kind of sick joke?"" sh** no, motherf**ing schizo
So disturbed, he just goes so berserk, he tiptoes
Fist first with scissors to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
So-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp
So lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn here comes another ""Clockwork Orange""

It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Picking up transvestites on my Harley-Davidson (hey hop on)
My girlfriend's a crackhead who*e
She'll come to your door, s** your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store (n***a, I'm takin these)
Have you ever seen a b**h get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and s** another n***a's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me)



I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry) I had to eat it (ohh)
My dick is burning, it ain't cause of disease
Because I'm jacking off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (AHH!)
I'm living in Waco Texas, me and my girl
f** David Koresh, I'm starting my own world
It's called Bizarre Cemetery, it's scary
Eating a virgin's cherry; they're all gonna laugh at you, Carrie!

Rifle slash knife f*ggot that's your ""Cop k**er""
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was living (aight)
Cross-dressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek; I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at

8,3 Verses,https://lyrics.az/eminem/f**ing-crazy/3-verses.html,eminem,"I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer (?)
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a f**ed up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And aint sh** changed
But kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of d**h
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
sh**, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
f** it, you only live once you might as well die now
It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
Warlord of rap little ba*tard with a two by four board
That smashed into your Honda Accord
With a 4 door Ford
But a more toward (?) droppin an accapella
The choppa (?) fella
The mozarella
Worse than a hellacopta propella
Got you locked in the cella
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia
While I'm standin next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to d**h
With an IV in your veins
Feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of d**
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the a**es ripped outta they pants



And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
It's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'M STILL ALIVE!""
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start sh** (?)
Got your b**h wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the f**ing head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
f** an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombas (?)
We blowin up your house k**ing your parents
and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I aint making no more threats
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack (?)
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

9,Campaign Speech,https://lyrics.az/eminem/for-president/campaign-speech.html,eminem,"Jumped out of the second floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four ca**ette and a ca**ette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Eminem speaks out against Donald Trump on ""Campaign Speech""
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless sores and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And s**ual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend
Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have been vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in and the shredded foreskin
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores in sore shins
Pregnant who*es can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, I mess up once
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, ""When you wanna get s**ual?""
She said, ""However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible.""
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Kathryn Beck
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' hara**ed, sign an autograph
For this a**hole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock
One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack for an axle, walked in a Ba** Pro Shop with David Ha**elhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was f**in' stupid...
You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this b**h
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
b**h, get to ma**agin' this dick!
Like spas in this b**h, slob on it, with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a b**h on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick sh**
But I shout derogatives at b**hes like f**in' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, ""I hate blondes,"" and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start sh**
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble 'cause a double cross
The shadiest mothaf**a you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some a**aults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to ""Brain Damage,""what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-f** persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss a** like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'



And that's what you wanted
A f**in' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the bu*ton, who doesn't have to answer to no one - great idea!
If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screaming, ""f** safe s**!""
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
It's in you to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket, with a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy a**es in the backseat
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me
Dead pa**enger in the pa**enger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic
And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge k**er of bin syllable binge
Fill a syringe, till I
Draw first blood
Even pop sh** on my pop sh**, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Tortured a, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious f**er
The rock cuts into rock cause who would have thought
This much of a co*ks**er that go across the bu*tocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unrevealing quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeves' spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I had to come back on these f*ggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a f**ing Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplating rubbing sh** in your face till I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had f**ing careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, you puss
And thighs are squooshed
What kind of attires that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track
Why am I such a dick?"
10,My Fault (pizza Mix),https://lyrics.az/eminem/mtv-celebrity-d**hmatch/my-fault-pizza-mix.html,eminem,"* eminem does the voices of all characters in the song *
[g] eminem as susan (the girl)
[d] eminem as dave
[j] eminem as john
[r] eminem as ron
Chorus: repeat 2x
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
[eminem]
I went to john's rave with ron and dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from houston
Who love booze and alternative music (whattup?)
Told me she was starvin, i said it wasn't a problem (nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage
[g] i'm allergic to fungus
Come on sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door??	pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? wasn't it yours? nuh uh
[g] if you got it with double mushrooms on it then i don't want it
Shutup susan i'll pick em off it
Oh hell, i might as well try it, i'll be alright
Susan you just swallowed the wrong slice!!
Chorus: 1st repeat em says ""i'm sorry!"" at the end
2nd repeat same as original chorus
""yo sue!""
[g] get away from me, i don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping..
[g] i need to go puke!! (bleahh!)
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin, i don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase you and spank you with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said,
[g] help me i think i'm havin a seisure!



I said, ""you're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!""
""would you put it down you're startin to scare me""
She said,
[g] i'm twenty-six years old and i'm not married
I don't even have any kids and i can't cook
(hello!) i'm over here sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause i never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate
Chorus: 1st repeat em says ""whoops!"" after first line
And ""it was an accident!"" at the end
2nd repeat same as original chorus
Susan (wait!) where you goin? you better be careful
[g] leave me alone dad, i'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find dave he majored in allergies
""john, where's dave at before i bash you?""
[j] he's in the bathroom; i think he's takin a crap dude!
""dave! pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
Choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of spring break, how long do these things take to wear off?""
[d] well it depends on how many pieces she ate
Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives""
[d] she's gonna die dude
""i know and it's my fault!""
[d] my god!!!
Chorus: 1st repeat em says ""i'm sorry!"" after second line
And ""what do i do?"" at the end

You're not dead!! you're not dead!
I know you're not dead!

11,Despicable,https://lyrics.az/eminem/road-to-recovery/despicable.html,eminem,"[Eminem]
I come around like what goes around.
What goes up must come down.
Anyone who comes up must go down.
Might as well go for the gusto now.
Better not let up, better not let them breathe.
Last shot give it all you got.
Try to turn me down b**h get f**ed with the volume nob,
f** all you snobs.
Hoes I hope all you rot.
Two bottles of luburdom and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
And you wanna minaj a trois, you twots?
f** that I'd rather turn this club to a ballroom brawl.
Get as rowdy as Routhlisberger in a bathroom stall.
Like a leaf stuck in a vacuum ya'll ain't nothtin but a whole lot of s**in' goin' on in rap.
Yeah but I'm home.
Bad to the bone, back in the zone
Let him alone,
You don't wanna go eggin' him on.
It'll never be my chair that you're on.
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen.
Otherwords there's no heir to the throne.
When I die so does hip hop.
Hitchco*k better sh** b**h a** gotgot a zip locked in a bag.
You f*gs ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top.
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone, like I'm in the twilight dog get off my bone this is my mic doggone it I like hogging it.
Flow so wet I'ma take this beat tobogganin.
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it.
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it.
Suplexin it on cement, like I'm on some straight outta compton sh**
Take this dick and chomp on it.



I'm so bad I can b**h slap a back handed compliment.
Jacka** eat a donkey dick.
The game I just about conquered, it like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers b**h, I'm the king of this honkey sh**, I reign supreme in this honkey sh**.
No sense screaming and arguing.
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in.
You think you ball, well I palm it.
I throw up bombs when I vomit.
Boy I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelet.
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic.
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze.
b**h I'm as bat sh** as Ozzy, it's obvious, you can tell I go right off the bat.
No pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head.
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web, I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage.
I catch a fly in that b**h.
You think you fly, you just food.
I give as much of a flying f** as that superman dude.
Guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and bamboozled, confused as usual, and you can get ripped she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat, or stay the f** outta hell's kitchen
I came to co*k block like a square f**ing male chicken.
Yeah, it's Shady s*ut, the rest can s** on a big one.
'Cause I'm despicable as daffy duck when I'm spitting.

12,I Remember,https://lyrics.az/eminem/sh**-on-you-artist-d12-single/i-remember.html,eminem,"Your mother, you f**in' f*got
La da da, da da da, da da
La da da, da da da, da da
La da da, da da da, da da
Aiyo, this next song is
Dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget
About you, you f**in' h*mo
We still remember
There once was a man
Who liked to jump around
(Jump around)
But he got too old to jump up and down
(Up and down)
(So then what happened?)
So he put the mic down
And picked the guitar up
(Picked the guitar up)
(And then he what?)
Started singin' the blues
Like there's no tomorrow
(No tomorrow, come on)
Left his boys in the house of pain
(The house of pain)
It was the wisest decision he ever made
(Ever made)
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
I remember back when you had
The Knack
(Had the knack)
And I remember when you had
Your first heart attack
(Heart attack)
I was right there laughin'
When I heard the news
(Heard the news)
I just wish the cardiac
Would'a murdered you
(Would'a murdered you)
Maybe Ice-T's right
You are a b**h
(You are a b**h)
You come around when you're broke
And you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
Remember back in '94, like right before
Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When house of pain was out of fame
Like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again



Or even further back, when I first had heard The Knack
And you were down with Syndicate
I went to get your sh**, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the sh**
Now you sound ridiculous you dick less piece of sh**,
How could you diss me, b**h?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech
When I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin', then you left the room
And didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you was mad that someone else was
White and tried to rhyme or somethin'
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin' to steal your light or nothin'
But you're a h*mos**ual, white rappin' Irish f*got
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a f*got too
Then I'd be confused as you
And I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you?
I never f**ed with you
Why would you f** with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you
What, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you
And I don't f**in' sing
And probably play guitar better
And I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, sh** you was me in '92
So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you
And maybe that will help me know
What it's like to sing the blues
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old a** sing no more
You f**in' punk, p**y
You f**in' f*got, sissy, f**
And by the way, a three-eighty's a f**in' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a f**in' real gun
You little b**h
Next time say
My f**in' name in a song
Don't be subliminal about it
You wanna f**in' diss me
Diss me you f**in' f*got
You f**in' punk, p**y
You f**in' little b**h, f**in' c*nt"

Ryan's a homicidal misfit, I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your a**
Before I write your sh**, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my b**h a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you n***as floating in water, then go and drown a fish
f**, I'm f**ing heinous, I make you f**ing famous
Them lead showers is coming, f** is you saying?
[Eminem]
fu*k! It's f**ing raining, sh*t! There's lightning, b*tch!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, sh*t!
sh*t! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit f**ing the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
sh**, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, f** a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye
[Hook: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind, you think you f**ing with us
s** on these nuts, b**h, hang it up, this game is over
[Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching ""I Love Lucy"" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the f** could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I k** the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of a**es that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to k** you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight
[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers



You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated d**h multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, n***a
And you going to need the best doctors, house n***a
Guard your j**els and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, n***as ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock
[Hook]
[Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell sh** and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark sh** with no heart
[Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, b**h, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay co*king the round
I sh** logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
sh**, they think I'm Illuminati, so f**ing ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-a** pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
b**h, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling ""Go Shady!"" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
b**h, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't f**ing with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over
[Eminem]
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
[Yelawolf]
Game over!"

[Eminem]
Here we go again
[50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on fire
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone
But don't compare me
I'm better off jus' left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin wreckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherf**er Ja musta lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along and fight you
Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you
k**in' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that sh** you on
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this sh** too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads wit any motherf**er that wants to
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'ma grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow,
another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on
[50 Cent]
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me 



You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me

You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars'll melt you
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin a new pistol
I clap at your a** with this chrome 38
And put six thru your hats of seven 3/8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and freeze ya on the turnpike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got robbed two times so ya a** is lame
I'm down to die for this sh** all I need is bail
You betta stick to tha movies with Steven Seigel, b**h
[50 Cent]
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me

You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me
[Lloyd Banks]
f** that I'm miles away
And these industry n***as startin' to get outta hand
I'ma find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man
Tellin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out tha game an'...
They see me more pop a boy for icey cuz I could
Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood
b**h when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared b**hes
You don't know nuttin' about what pain is s**a
I'll put your a** to the ground like a train conductor, muh'f**er

16,One Day At A Time (Em's Version),https://lyrics.az/eminem/tupac-resurrection/one-day-at-a-time-ems-version.html,eminem,"(2pac)
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open free, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay s**er free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...
(Eminem)
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
Thats why the f** I remain s**er free to this day
The game will never be the same



No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing....
(Outlawz)
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the j**elry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
Thats when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I can't win so I'm inviting some help
And every now and then I take rights from left
Im still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
No matter how much I try (stay alive)
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my a** cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop k**ers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin...
(2Pac)
...One day at a time. Damn!"
17,The Warning,https://lyrics.az/eminem/unreleased-artist-eminem/the-warning.html,eminem,"Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Was because you denied seeing me
Now I'm pissed off
Sit back, homie, relax
In fact grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts
Yeah Dre, sick track
Perfect way to get back
Wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat
That's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now
Oh gee, is that supposed to be me
In the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
b**h, shut the f** up before I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wild-n-out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out
You probably think cuz it's been so long
If i had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session
Down and sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the f** I do
Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too
f*ggot, you think I'm scared of you?
You gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some s*ut, b**h-c*nt
That made me put up with her psycho-a** over 6 months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky?
Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you f**ing had to be drunk to f** me?
Second base? What the f** you tell Nick, punk?
In the second week we were dry humping
That's gotta count for something
Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about
How I nutted early, 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling?
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarra**ing me
I'm embarra**ing you, and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as the song's getting airplay, I'm dissing you



I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued
I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
This is 34 bars, we ain't even a third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you. Mariah who?
Oh, did I say ""who*e"", Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time for no reason
Girl you out ya alcholic mind
Check ya wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I f**in' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this sh** is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But f** it now I'm bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
I ain't saying this sh** again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot before I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every f**ing thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot
Slim Shady, Slim Shady, I love you
I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say?
It's nothing
Yeah, so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said, ""I want you""
Now should I keep going, or should we call truce?
You think you cute, right?
You bet your sweet a** I do
I'm Mary Poppins, B
And I'm Superman, mmm
Mary P., Slim Shady
Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my baby girl
Then I'll still be your superhero
Oh my, Em
Yeah, I'm right here
You like this
Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a knife when I tell you get a life
But I'm movin' on with mine
Nick, is that your wife?
Well tell her to shut her mouth, then I'll leave her alone
If she don't stick to the script, then I'mma just keep goin'
Damn
I see Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying, ""Cut the tape, cut the tape""
Knife!"

Ayo, what do you think about, two grown a** men, living together?
Haha, alright, what do you think about, another grown a** man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well, them two grown a** men living together on my nuts
And that's you right above them
Get the f** off them!
[Bridge X2]
Run that sh** back DJ Whoo Kid!
Run that sh** back one more time!
[Verse]
When I rhyme, somehow I think I must be subliminally throwing
Viagra at these f*gs that got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows



Nothing is off limits, except for Michael's nose
I didn't know, I'm so sorry, please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended
Ooh, I got it, I got an apology for Steve Harvey too
It's in my pocket, uh, wait, here it is: fu*k YOU!
Hey! What do you say, Andre? What's new?
Life is good, man I'm chilling, 50 how bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, we'll get through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace, G-G-G-unit!"
19,Bane,https://lyrics.az/eminem/shady-xv/bane.html,eminem,"You can never Ow me

20,Asshole,https://lyrics.az/eminem/the-marshall-mathers-lp-2/a**hole.html,eminem,"[Verse 1:]
I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An a**hole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my sh** list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would k** him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping sh**, but since when did this many
People ever give a sh** but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That's like telling Gwen Stefan' that she sold out
Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down
In history think they know now
Because everybody knows
[Hook - Skylar Grey:]
Everybody knows that you're just an a**hole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
""Oh, everyone knows""
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an a**hole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
[Verse 2:]
Thanks for the support, a**hole [*scratch*] thanks for the support, a**hole
Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your a** socked in the mouth
Lay'em off it
But what the f** is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knock me down, I went down from the counter
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the f**ing pants off me
To take my belt, word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little sh** what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock



Just to go out watch Batman
Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo
My soul's escaping through this a**hole that is gaping
A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I'm not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating cause everybody knows
[Hook]
[Verse 3:]
Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinking we have some magnetic pull
Then scream ""ICP in this b**h! How do f**ing magnets work!?""
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, It's tragical
Thinking some magical sh**'s gonna happen? That ain't practical
You cracking a joke, it's laughable, cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
b**h you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded.
Thinking you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna, hunt me down like a dog, cause you're on my a**
But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother trying
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it further
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherf**ing father time
And it ain't never gonna stop. A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime, so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half-empty gla** in a cup, so now my cup has runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherf**ing coaster
I'm going back to what got me here, yeah co*ky, and can't knock being Rudolph so fear not my deer, and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward and weird, if you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too. You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows."

I'm a k** him
I'm going to f**in' jail

22,BET Shady 2.0 Cypher,https://lyrics.az/eminem/bet-shady-2-0-cypher/bet-shady-2-0-cypher.html,eminem,"[Intro: eminem]
Welcome to detroit
This is the bet shady 2.0 cypher, 2011
Myself, slaughterhouse, and yelawolf
White dog, get em!
[Verse 1: yelawolf]
Put these mutha****as in a box and I send em away
Put em in a gray 'lac and pop the trunk
And throw em in the back, jack
Ha, dig em a grave
Put a brick inside that? when I put em in a page
Moving keys I can relate, cause I live in the cage
I throw up the a, I take em to school, I give them a grade
An easy e for effort, that's the wwa
White with an attitude, alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is z's they sleepin' on me, I can't get em awake
I spoon feed em? room full of deceivers
Believe I'm making it rain
Cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the vip like a potato
A bunch of meatheads, like **** it, I'll just feed em a cow
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper
You better pick up your heater
Cause even peter piper could pick up a mic
But what it's like to pick a fight with me is like putting nikes on a cheetah
I speed up, released in my? adidas
I'm out this ****, drinking sprite by the 2 liter
[Verse 2: joe budden]
Say I'm from the new school
I'mma say check your tone and watch your mouth
If they teaching how to dougie, then I'm condoning dropping out
Forced to wild, y'all birthed me then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hop's foster child
Now check it: don't blame y'all for being trash fans of coppin' it
Radio's the crime scene, the ma**es are the hostages
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fads was dodging it
I'm grown: I ain't watching the throne, I'm sabotaging it
You see that 4-headed monster in the storm looms
Snipe em from a distance: the scope got a long zoom
You super mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure over here, you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be about
I done took the wine out of amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats bout co*kin' a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I have this **** from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she doubt david is stern
She's so bad, I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the holiday inn, learned that from max b
That's why haters of envy, kind wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes like I was Benihanas
Is it me, or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?
Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical
My skin's thick, so the critics ignore it
So unafraid to die, you'd think I did it before
The boys robbin with the trash talk
Magic or Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphault with cat paws
Gla** jaw, hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no pa**port
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trap doors
If punks had award your status who*es categore
Probably be that of awards between michael rappaport and kenny latimore
I know hip hop's alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell
[Verse 3: crooked I]
I squad a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin
I caught him slippin', I gotta give a shot
I hit him with proper spittin
Hottest writtens and compositions
So competition's a contradiction, somebody mention they got a crooked
Holly? we probably different, got gotti henchmen
Opposition, I'll body quick as bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get richer
The sickest lyric kickin diggin a ditch
Weak lyricists get disfigured, sip liquor
Spit like a sick mixture of notorious, pun, and l
Get the big picture?
The poster, I'll roast ya
My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
It's over, control my whole coastal region like I'm supposed to
Flow is going postal even
Open season, heart close to freezin'
Ruthless is easy
Approach, I'm squeezin' ****a, believe me
Dopest west coaster breathin'
So most ya hope I'm vegan, nope I'm beefin
Rappers need to keep it trill
Give me a beat to k**, too many people still eatin' sleepin' pills
People sleepin' on my ether sk**s
Ay, y'all ain't even real
You bout to die in this cypher
Before you die, you should do the jada and leave a will
[Verse 4: joell ortiz]
I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this, I was moving crack
k**ers y'all become when y'all rhyme I salute and dap
And if I blink then remove your snaps
You ain't cool, you whack with your foolish act
Skinny jeans don't mean yo a** shoot, it means your booty claps



Don't play like tyler perry
This the slaughterhouse of pain
Flow brown, tight, and heavy
When it come to 16s, I'm a feign
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writing bars to Nas' Thief Theme. gettin my YAOWA on
Man, all these olajuwons, we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They feigning for us to break like beyonce's water
The four quarters doing all the eating
And ya'll gotta know why I made the cut, I'm puerto rican
Ortiz keep they fire ready
And trying to put me out's like trying to steal a transvestite from eddie
[Verse 5: royce da 5'9""]
I'm do or die dope and you can make the sticker sittin
On the door of that phantom, your suicide note
Hi rihanna... is nicki living with you?
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi rihanna... I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye rihanna... now back to y'all fools
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames, I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing about budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why I keep her, I say it's cheaper to
That's why I ride around in a rolls like wiz khalifa do
Rappers I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't k**, but your father will like jayden smith
I tell you like I tell my spanish chick
You fly, but I ain't going down on no landing strip
So get your wax on like daniel san
Or I'mma have to run like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive.
I head-shot him
Smack his girl on the bu*t and buy her some Red Bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber-s**ing with Jessica Alba, via Skype
I'm on my D-Boy/Deebo thing, spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with you b-roll bling.
Your flow is wack.
We cornered the market like a Walmart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah, this what 2 million albums sold, and an album that's gold
Look like without having to sell your soul
Nickle!
[Verse 6: eminem]
Wait, can I rap?
Lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal subliminal
In your swimming pool
You about to see peace destroyed
It'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your cd stores
Wanna stop it? you gon' need a priests, at least three swords
A ""License to iLL"" from the Beastie Boys, three Ouija boards
A squeegee and please be warned, don't ask what the squeegee's for
Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, do you see these horns?
And as for me you ask when I'm gone ""will he be mourned?""
Is puke luke warm? should Casey Anthony do p**n?
Can that chick fit a new born dead baby inside a frickin' shoebox with a shoehorn,
smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on?
Can she duct tape and velcro a fetus?
Joell yo, tell Joe I need his empty box from his old shell-toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in the fetal position, they gettin' elbows to the penis
Yeah big deal
I took some little kids Big Wheel and spit in his firggin big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch me you wench, sit still
Did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz windsheild! ?
Is it dust we bout to kick up?
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his friggin' pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hill billy will til he gets hiccups! ?
Flippin' the script up like Mike Vick gettin' his junk bit by a pit,
Yup, I'mma sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician, cause I'll **** a trick up
Fix your lips up to say somethin' fly, or zip up
A. B, lets C, you said you were gonna do x-y-z
Till you **** around and get dropped like an ""E""
When you add an i-n-g
Do put a ""K"" in front of that though, when I'm.C.
I'm not the king of the microphone boo, it's more like a phone booth
Superman in this ****, Kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power, I bump the Fat Boys
And eat rat poison, take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossin' a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit'll
Be like Nas doin' gospel or rn'b
you crazy?
Me pushin' them daises?
that thought is impossible
Is it flashin' across the news, ""Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson, b**bs, and a monstrous tube of lube
And a bra, some boots, some panties, in a aqua blue Mazda
Swallowin' a popsicle, playing tonsil pool
So k** the rumors it ain't happenin',
I'ma rap till I'm fossil fuel"

Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat?
Custom mustard stain

But, sh**, I'm stingy as f**



I'm f**in' stingy as hoes
These b**hes don't get a crumb, and it come
but I'm like what up
Shut up, b**h, sit up, get up off them knees
My candy paint's enough
If you're lucky, I'll let you hug me, but that's all you get
Then I'ma split, disappear, a cloud of smoke is all you see
Yeah...
Ballin' Uncontrollably
Ballin' Uncontrollably
Ballin' Uncontrollably
B-ballin' Uncontrollably

b**h, get the f** out my car if we ain't finna f**
I'm horny as f**, b**h, are you s**in' my dick or what?
I'll f** a chick in the bu*t, I really don't give a sh**
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a b**h?
You f**in' keyed up my Benz
b**h, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a b**h
I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You f**in' retard, I'll have you s**in' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the f** do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I f**in' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV?
Turn around and use it on me
You tryna snort on my keys?
You f**in' broad, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me,
Tell your momma I'ma drop you off at the hospital later
We finna make this run
Take this gun and cover me, Slater
And quit your...

24,Airplanes Part 2,https://lyrics.az/eminem/look-at-me-now/airplanes-part-2.html,eminem,"Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night skies
Like shooting stars
I can really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (Dreamin', I'm fallin, dreamin', I'm fallin') Lets pretend like its 98, like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now lets pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (OK)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big a** stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Lets try to use imagination [Chorus] OK, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had a dream of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my cla**es
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now lets pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre



Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes [Chorus] (And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream, but those days are gone they're just memories) Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it,
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward but as strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as sh-t
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as sh**
F-ck a talent show in the gymnasium b**h
You won't amount to sh-t quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this sh-t
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C sh**
Cause he never risked sh-t he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap he ain't even here he pretends that [Chorus]"
25,25 To Life,https://lyrics.az/eminem/recovery/25-to-life.html,eminem,"[Hook]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
[Verse 1]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this b**h had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life
I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain, b**h, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it: I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I f**ing get repaid?
Look at how I dress: f**ing baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to f**ing step
And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your f**ing breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I f**ing left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's
[Hook]



[Verse 2]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same sh** that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish b**h
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to sh**
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
f** you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, b**h and it's just...
[Hook]"
26,3 a.m.,https://lyrics.az/eminem/relapse/3-a-m.html,eminem,"[Intro]
There is no escaping
There's no place to hide
You scream, ""Someone save me!""
But they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye!
[Verse 1]
You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the morning and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible
Right there's the coroner, waiting for you to
Turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run, all you want is to rest
'Cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to k** you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin
While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's, with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, sh**
Guess I must've just blacked out again—not again!
[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some b**bs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana, then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle, and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to



Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them
[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack, my last Vic and a half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's a**
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, ""I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun.""
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdlin' screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret pa**ageway 'round here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause…
[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door, and
Bodies layin' all over the floorin'
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've k**ed 'em, k**ed 'em

Better watch out, s**a now I gotcha where I want ya
Onslaught, comin and I'm packin in my lunch up
Bunch of, missile launchers and a bunch of contra-
-band, van full of ganja, now come on jump
Man stop, mashin Marshall on my gotcha
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quadra-
-plegic, boogeyin down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the buddah do to me what it's done
Such cynicism when this isn't in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips son
So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks
""Mister, help me"" 's what he said to me and then sunk
Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa bu*ter skin once
[Chorus: Eminem]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
[Eminem]
Always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways
Carca**es of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
Hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Well f** it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe



After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummagin
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want to skin
Been, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win
Severin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb
Pull the lever then, trapdoor, d**h is evident
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin so chill
f**in who*e you better f**in hold still
Make sure none of that, lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffin those girls
Man I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her then I'll wait, I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I f**in told you!
I keep hearin voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her while you put ya shish-kabob skewers
Into her, barbecue her or would you do to her
What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?
[as Yoda] ""In a world of sin you are, this is turnin into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!""
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
Boo-yah, who ya think you're f**in with; duck because here he comes again

Now a n***as gon' get
Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin on some Don perion
While she's sippin up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on the brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' superfulious
With no purpose n***a
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this n***a
That's comin' from the same turf as yas
What nerves have yas
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a sh**
I'm gettin' rich
I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig?
With a b**h
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake

And yup it's probably ease when a n***a is on board

Cry now
n***a cry now
I'll be damned if I let a n***a lay his hands on me
I'll lay his a** out
And park a grand dam on him
The city where the weak survive
And the strong die
Where beef collides
Shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst
And what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets
Dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse
n***as frontin' for a b**h
It's like you beggin' to die
Like bear huntin' with a switch
A part of my heart is gone
I could never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy
It'll take awhile to tame
Detroit is hella dirty
But the dozen can fix it
Resist and the biscut will exceed the distance
And bounce off one's home
Hit and riquoche off a kid's trombone
Right to where you n***as lay
Obie can tell you that d**h is just a few inches away
Yall shed tears
But yall can get your feel of it today
I know
Cry now

Obie they gotta f** with us this time n***a
Bobby Creek

Laugh now
Cry never
My bereta is a body part
Hit him with just enough shots
To make his body hard



Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you n***as
Diseasin'
Soon as I get my karma right on Lindsy Rose
I'm leavin'
Load up a clip
And make it dark on them heroes cheesin'
sh** they got snitches on the clock
Gotta watch what I'm sayin'
Me buy a b**h a couple rocks
And the watch quit playin'
Back on my greasy
My neezy
Nobody bread whippin
And for them f**in' spectators
I brought the band with me
Halftime n***as

Witness art of war
In the phyical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from cash mouth is fixin'
Ready with dope clips
I'm ever dissin'
My aura of war is raw to the core
The surface of the street
When I walk through the door
My purpose is to move up
Pull tools
You perpin'
Watch me overthrow the government
In my turban
Plot up and line up
Solo mia
Prayin' to proof
I'm searchin for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother
Gone in the streets of the D

And hopin' n***as waitin on me

The second rounds on me
And when the wars on the other side
Me and my brother ride

With a gun with a ? with a bat
Take a slug through the lung

Poppin' long dick
Stabbed it out the box like hockey
Especially when a b**h ride it like jockey
From the benz to the range to the black joloppy

[ Eminem ]
WAAAHHHOOOOOO , hahaha (laughs)
guess who's back !?
mommy , we're home
say hello to my little friends , DJ Muggs , Soul Assa**ins , Cypress Hill
everybody , put your hands where my eyes can see
[ Eminem ]
everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as f** , forty fifty Samoans , they knowin' when D-Bo was
50 , Tweezy , Obie there won't be no hoe in us , they pop sh** like they gon' do sh** but no one does
from New York down to Texas , back up to Los Angeles , we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up gettin' rushed by too many to handle us , it's funny I guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched , it's not like we're just feelin' ourselves that much
it's just , that if someone ever does put us in the clutch , we just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
cause first of all you're p**y and everybody can see that , you f** around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in , we ain't even gon' be in it , no one's gonna hear nothin , no one's gonna see this sh**
and they'll be in and up out of it , them boys is bout it , bout it , the noise from (???) be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be layin' on the ground gettin' trampled by people dancin' , till the club closes and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened , nobody saw it happen , all cause your jaws are flappin'
and you couldn't stop yappin' and took it past rappin' , it ain't about the music no more , it's about tryin' to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off
[Chorus - Eminem]
sh**'s about to change , cause we ain't playin' no games
we ain't budgin' neither are they , we ain't sayin' no names
sh** just ain't the same , when the K's get to scream
hip hop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hip hop , cause those days are gone
it ain't about tryin rip shots , to get props no more



it's about tryin' not to get popped , and get dropped to the floor
cause hip hop is in a state of 911
[B-Real]
step off my holster cause sh** it's gettin' serious , all these d** you be f**in' with make you delirious
thinkin' you coming with heat , yo son I'm curious , how long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us ?
some people can never fade us , that make us so furious , mistake us for fakers , homie we great but glorious
we livin' for real and others just makin' the stories up , allusions are broken , so live it up , you corny f**s
if you take a f**in' minute to think about what you've done , when you stood against the gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one , sprayin' you b**hes till there is none , i'm like a rolling stone homie , I got you under my thumb
you silly little b**hes can end up right up in ditches , we cut you and give you stitches , for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget , you're clockin' a small digit , dealin' with the Giant Goliath , people that's how we live it , c'mon
[Chorus]
[Ganxsta Ridd]
uh , gangsta gangsta who come to pay you a visit , on this sh** you call hip hop , this function is where did it
when I put it in motion , my focus is gettin' branded , my appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
got you stumblin' for cover , this music dyin' in numbers , but you wouldn't pause and wonder , admittin it's all glamour
when you enter the business you thinkin' you runnin sh** , you witness that funny sh** , your b**hes they ain't sh**
we gangstas we blast first , ask questions later , all these imitators parading like they some playaz
tryin' to save hip hop the task is somethin greater , cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught , I'm not tellin' , or more like k**in' not caring , i'm ridin' a gangsta feelin' , no fearing when gangstas dyin'
I'm in a full circle with homies that supposed to bleed , on an 8 mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

I done figured this rap sh** out
I map sh** out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
sh** not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
Victims to stick I'm fixin to pick some and start sh**
I'm outta [repeat]
Pictures to rip and sh** to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, sh** Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to d**h, Benzino went deaf
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is p**y
Why the f** you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't sh** goin on, sh** I been gettin so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin some sh** to get you to go and hate me again



To tell the truth, I liked the sh** better then
sh** I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick sh** again, look
The game just isn't the same, it's changin
sh** Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin the same sh**
It's ancient, it's fakin
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
You think I'm the new ossama, press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us"

The weak or the strong, who got it goin on
You're dead wrong
[notorious b.i.g.]
Relax and take notes, while i take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherf**er say your prayers
Hail mary full of grace.. smack the b**h in the face;
Take her gucci bag and the north face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, i just want the paper
The visa, kapeesha? i'm out like, ""the vapors""
Who's the one you call mr. macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like camacho, i got so
Much style i should be down wit the stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} n***az need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then f** your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember sh**! just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
s**in on the tits! had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess i was a combination of house of pain and bobby brown
I was ""humpin around"" and ""jump-in around""
Jacked her then i asked her who's the man; she said, ""b-i-g""
Then i bust in her e-y-e (yo big, you're dead wrong)
Chorus 2x + ""i don't care what nobody say"" sample (4x at start)

When i get dusted, i like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over lucifer, i'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, i'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, i hit 'em with the tech g
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly



I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she s**ed the dick, i stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to f** him from the back
But smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; f**ed him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is f**in feelin it!
Hardcore, i got it s**ed like a p**y
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know i love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what i mean?

[puff]	ladies and gentlemen..

There's several different levels to devil worshippin: horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, canibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals havin s** with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But i don't get into that, i kick the habit - i just,
Beat you to d**h with weapons that eat through the flesh
And i never eat you unless the f**in, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, i'm lyin, i got a nine in my pocket
And baby i'm just, dyin to co*k him
He's ready for war, i'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any f*ggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, i lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin, red on the floor, get a new who*e
Met on the second, wet on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - i'm dead wrong

33,Cleanin' Out My Closet,https://lyrics.az/eminem/curtain-call-the-hits/cleanin-out-my-closet.html,eminem,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherf**ing kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' a** in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My f*ggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just f**in' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest sh** I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have k**ed 'em, sh**, I woulda shot Kim and him both 



It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
b**hin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and sh**'s missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
b**h do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish b**h, I hope you f**ing burn in hell for this sh**
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

Oh a line with fakes a time
Fresh time, with sure more times
Jimminy two time respect mine
Big click with breakfast and blacklist
War! War! War! War!
Vision, knocking you out motherf**er listen
Superstition can help you in this battle
G's and sandles who surround you in all the angles
All over your sh** in shamble
Looking the little of latter you f**ing runt

Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!

Danger hander
Banging swinging banner all single hander
Hit the left propaganda
Ill manner bad grammar stander
Got the people chasing with cameras by the manner 



Hit and slap us, so pajamas
Hiding under clothes in dirty hampers
Happy brands will make them happy campers
Little laughter
sh** nappers
(Eminem)
I'll puke eat and freak you
Battle, I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you them both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I lift you off your feet so fast with a round house
You'll think I pulled the f**ing ground out from underneath you
I ain't no f**ing g, I'm a canibal
I ain't trying to shoot you, I'm trying to chop you into pieces and eat you
Rap you in rope and gla**, strapped to a soakin matress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
f** the planet until it spins on a broken axis

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I done touched on everything, but little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK (Fart Sound)
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance

Crusin' on the freeway

Get the top down, let my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah

Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said save it boy
We got you on tape
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body""
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit
You signed me up to battle?

Ya'll know me still the same ol' g
But i been low key
Hated on by most these n***as with no cheese, no deals and no g's
No wheels and no keys no boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me cause i can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But ya'll think i'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho please, you better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the o' g's
Eazy-e's ice cube's and d.o.c's and snoop d o double g's
And a group that said muthaf** the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
The bomb weed stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see
Ya'll better listen up closely
All you n***as that said that i turned pop
Or the firm flop, ya'll are the reason dre ain't been getting no sleep
So f** ya'll, all of ya'll
If ya'll don't like me, blow me
Ya'll are gonna keep f**in' around with me
And turn me back to the old me
[eminem](chorus x2)
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthaf**ers act like they forgot about dre
[eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of nwa.
One day i was walkin by
With a walkman on
When i caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot with his karl kani
I don't give a f** if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
But i'm drunk as f**
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage



Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
f** you too b**h call the cops
I'ma k** you and 'em loud a** muthaf**in barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still one found out right here
From here on out it's the chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And i'm still loco and nuts to choke you to d**h with a charleston chew
Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a mercedes benz with the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men ladies
Sorry doc but i been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's ok go with him hailey
(chorus) x2
[DRE]
If it was up to me
You muthaf**ers would stop comin' up to me
With your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last cd was out you weren't bumpin me
But now that i got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause i'm from the streets of
I told 'em all
All little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like i ain't got none
What you think i sold 'em all
Cause i stay well off
Now all i get is hate mail all day sayin' dre fell off
What, cause i been in the lab with a pen and a pad tryna get this damn label
Off
I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and f** rap you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that i was strapped with gats
When you were cuddled with cabbage patch

39,8 Mile,https://lyrics.az/eminem/8-mile-soundtrack/8-mile.html,eminem,"It's alright, it's ok, i'm gonna make it anyway
Verse 1
sometimes I just feel like, quittin,
I still might, why do I put up this fight, why do I still write,
sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life,
sometimes I just wanna jump on stage and just k** mic's,
and show these people what my level of sk**'s like,
but I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life,
something ain't right, hit the brake lights,
case of this stage fright, draw on the plane flight
call but I might fall,
it aint my fault crying eye balls'
my insides crawl and I clam up,
I just slam shut, I just can't do it,
my whole man-hoods, just been stripped,
I've just been picked so I must then get on the bus then split,
man f** this sh**, yo I'm going the f** home,
world on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road...
CHORUS
I'm a man, I'm a make a new plan,
time for me to just stand up and travel new land,
time to leave and just take matters into my own hands,
once i'm over these track man i'm a never look back,
and i'm gone and I know right where i'm goin,
sorry momma i'm grown, I must travel alone,
aint no followin footsteps, i'm making my own,
only way that I know how to escape from, 8 mile road...
Verse 2
Walking these train tracks trying to regain back,
the spirit I have before I go back to the same crap,
to the same plant, in the same pants,
trying to chase rap, gotta move a.s.a.p,
gotta get a new plan, momma's gotta new man,
poor little baby sister, she dont understand,
sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad,
and just colours until the crayon get dull in her hand,
while she just colours her big brother and mother and dad
there's no telling what really goes on in her little head,
wish that I could be the daddy that neither one of us had,
but I keep running from something I never wanted so bad,
sometimes I get upset, cause I aint blew up yet,
its like I grew up but I aint grown two nuts yet,
dont got a rep, my step, dont got enough pep,
the pressures too much man i'm just trying to do what's best,
and I try, sit alone and I cry, yo I wont tell her why,
not a moment goes by that I look right at the sky,
please i'm begging you god,
please dont let me be fishin holding no regular job,
yo I hope you will be getting home, whereva you are,
yo i'm telling you dog, i'm bailing this trailer tomorrow,
tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye,
say whenever you need me baby, i'm never too far,



but yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know,
and i'm a be back for you the second that I blow,
on everything I own, i'll make it on my own,
off to work I go, back to this 8 mile road...
CHORUS
Verse 3
You got to live it to feel it, you didn't then you wouldn't get it,
well see what the big deal is, why wasn't and still is,
to be walking this borderline of Detroit city limits,
its different in it, a certain significant of certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see but its everything to me,
its my credibility, you never seen, heard, smelt a meda ta MC,
who's incredible on the same pedestal as me,
the chaque still unsigned, having a rough time,
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes,
go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line,
but when it comes crunch time, where do my punch lines go,
who must I show, to bust my flow, where must I go, who must I know,
or am I just another grab in the bucket
cause I aint having no luck with this little rappers so f** it
maybe I need a new outlet, I'm starting to doubt sh**,
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with,
I look like a bum, yo my clothes aint about sh**,
at the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit,
and its cold trying to travel this road,
plus I feel like i'm always stuck in this battleing mode,
my defenses are so up one thing dont want it pity from no one,
this city is no fun, there is no sun and its so dark,
sometimes I just feel like, i'm being pulled a-part,
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends,
its enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin,
sometimes I just feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not,
what i'm doing I just blow my head is a stove top,
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot,
sometimes my mouth just overloads with acid, I dont got,
but I learned its time for me to U-Turn,
yo it only takes one time for me to get burned,
aint no callin her next time I need a new girl,
I can no longer play stupid or be immature,
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage,
like I already got the beat all I need is the word,
uh uh got the urge, suddenly its a surge,
suddenly a new burst of energy hits the curve,
time to show these free world leaders, three and the third,
I am no longer scared now, i'm free as a bird,
then I turn and cross over the medium curve,
hit the burbs and run and see its a blur, this 8 mile road...

41,Business,https://lyrics.az/eminem/the-eminem-show/business.html,eminem,"Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.
Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're f**in' right!
To the rap mobile, let's go!
Marshall! Marshall!
b**hes and Gentleman!
It's showtime!
Hurry, hurry, step right up!
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is
Marshall!
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you
Marshall!
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullsh** that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the sh**
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now
Let's get down to business



I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can sh** be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't f**in' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the sh** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
So there you have it folks
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullsh** does not pay
Because
Marshall!
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall!
So until next time friends
Same blond hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall!
Oh! Ha!"
42,Any Man,https://lyrics.az/eminem/platinum-collection-2001/any-man.html,eminem,"[Eminem]
Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple (hurry up!)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the b**h won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, ""I'm ready now b**h - ain't you feelin these kicks c*nt?""
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than s**m cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!)
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can s** my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to k** it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is f**in crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- do you hear me?
Is f**in crazy
[Eminem]
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a f*g in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium



than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if I keep on k**in my girlfriends
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is f**in crazy -- listen!!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is f**in crazy -- you hear me?
Is f**in crazy
[Eminem]
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
""Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been""
""It's probably AIDS!"" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dil*os
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady sh** that's on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn!

43,Drug Ballad,https://lyrics.az/eminem/marshall-mathers/drug-ballad.html,eminem,"[girl] yeaaah, hahahaha...whooooo, sh**!
[em](aight)
[eminem] guess what? i ain't coming in yet...
I'll come in a minute
[eminem] ayo...this is my love song...it goes like this
[eminem]
Back when mark walhberg was marky mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the, sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre-diction is you're gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinning
You're beginin' to think women
Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guiness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap b**hes
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up
[em's spaceman voice]earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Look at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And i'm so high that i might die if i go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so
Chorus
[eminem]
'cause every time i go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but i gotta stay
These d** really got ahold of me
'cause every time i try to tell them ""no""
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a s**a all i gotta say
These d** really got ahold of me
[eminem]
In third grade, all i used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
17 years later i'm as rude as jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest b**bs
I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So i don't need game to play
I just say whatever i want to whoever i want
Whenever i want, wherever i want, however i want
However, i do show some respect to few
As ecstacy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as f** spillin' guts to you



We just met
But i think i'm in love with you
But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like ""yo, what the f** we do?""
I gotta go b**h
You know i have stuff to do
'cause if i get caught cheatin' then i'm stuck with you
But in the long run
These d** are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But f** it, i'm on one
So let's enjoy
Let the x destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
sh**'s sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
sh**, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more
Chorus
[eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wollow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'cause none of the sh** is going to mean sh** where we're going
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like sh** every morning
But you're young
You've got a lot of d** to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
s**s to be you
If i could take it all back now, i wouldn't
I would have did more sh** that people said that i shouldn't
But i'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better d** and updated
But i've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done i'll be 40
Before i know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysiting for haley while haley's out getting smashed
Chorus 2x (same as previous, but 2nd time
The last line is repeated like this)
Drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me
'cause d** really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me

Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our sh**, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly sh**
You know what I'm sayin', some get high sh**
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy sh**, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that sh** he be doin'
[Hook: Slim Shady]
You ain't into f**in' d**, f** you
You don't do ecstasy, f** you
You don't pop mushrooms, f** you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, f** you
[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this sh**, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his a**
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em



I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
""Alright, Mr. Mathers, pick 'em up!""
No you pick 'em up! b**h, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this sh** no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office
[Hook: Slim Shady]
f*ggot, f** you, work at the post office, f** you
Talkin' sh** to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, f** you
If you're a f**in' dick, f** you
If you're a white rapper, f** you
Talk sh** about Stretch? You're cool
But if you don't talk sh** about Stretch, f** you
If you're a f**in' punk, f** you
Talk sh** about me, f** you
You wanna battle me, f** you
I ain't got to say sh** to you but f** you"
45,A*****e,https://lyrics.az/eminem/the-marshall-mathers-lp/a-e.html,eminem,"[Verse 1:]
Came to the world at a time when in was in need of a villain
An a**hole, that role think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speakin to children
Everything was happenin' so fast it was like I blinked, sold 3 million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man I coulda' stacked my sh** list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really
Thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would k** him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' sh** but since when did this many
People ever give a sh** what I had to say it's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin' put a dick in your rear-end
That's why every time you mention a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battled for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed atta-boy
They told me to slow down, I'd just zone-out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blopde, it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
'Cause I was tryin to leave No Doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now
Because everybody knows
[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]
Everybody knows, that you're just an a**hole
Everywhere that you go, people want to go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide, you are just an a**hole
Everyone knows, everyone knows Thanks for the support, a**hole [x2]
[Verse 2:]
Quit actin' salty, I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well God damn honky that compliment's like back-handin' a donkey, good way to get your a** socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him, but what the f**'s all this trash talking about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
I went down for the count, I fell but the fans caught me and now
You're gonna have to beat the f**in' pants off me to take my belt
Word to Pacquiao, momma said there ain't nothin else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin'
Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'till your bullet riddled, but you should give little sh** what I think
This whole world is a mess, gotta have a goddamn



Vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs ta test a testicles? Not that man
Half you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
Water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo my soul's escaping through this a**hole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper
But I'm takin' no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole and I'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go, tryin' to dip out the back door retreating
'Cause everybody knows
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
Holy mackerel. I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth I smacked a girl
Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed ""ICP in this b**h! how do f**in' magnets work? '
'Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable, hate to be dramatical but I'm not romantical
L'm makin' up words, so you can understandable
It's tragical, thinkin' some magical sh**'s gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin'
A joke? It's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded
Full body armor b**h, you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a trainwreck, I gotta one track mind and shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49'er
'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner
Been tryin' ta hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my a** but you can't get a cent
'Cause all of my spare time's spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther, so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been parent I'll never grow up, so to Hell with your parents and 'mother' f** 'father' time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half-empty gla** in a cup now my cup has runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a muthaf**in' coaster
L'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah co*ky and
Can't knock bein' Rudolph, so fear not my deer
And dry up your tear drops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock be
Cause everybody knows

46,Criminal (Snippet),https://lyrics.az/eminem/the-marshall-mathers-lp-snippet-tape/criminal-snippet.html,eminem,"[Intro]
A lotta people ask me stupid f**ing questions
A lotta people think that what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna k** somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well sh**, if you believe that, then I'll k** you
You know why? Cause I'm a criminal
[Hook]
I'm a criminal! Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take sh** from no one
[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a f*g or lez
Or the h*mos**, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate f*gs? the answer's ""yes""
h*mophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherf**in' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!



And I was just checking the mail, get it? Checking the 'male'?""
How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
""Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these f**in' retards
And to think, it's just little old me
Mr. Don't Give a f** still won't leave
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Mother did d**, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as-"
47,As The World Turns,https://lyrics.az/eminem/slim-shady-explicit/as-the-world-turns.html,eminem,"Chorus: repeat 2x
I dont know why this world keep turning
Round and round
But i wish it would stop, and let me off right now
Yes man
As the world turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
[eminem]
I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
And light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
Cuz we're dope as f** and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool,takin a sh** in a warm pool
They threw me out the ramada inn
I said it wasn't me, i got a twin (oh my god its you! not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cuz i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors
Cla** clown freshman, dressed like les nessman
f** the next lesson, i'll past the test guessin
And all the other kids said eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only cla** he'll pa** is phys ed
May be true, till i told this b**h in gym cla**
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed slim fast (who me?)
Yeah b**h you so big you walked into big tanny's and stepped on jenny craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then i thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin (rarrrr!)
It began storming, i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that b**h by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While i drop this b**h face down and watch her belly flop
Chorus
As the world turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day
[eminem]
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as f** and only get a 2 in the source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and i'm still tryna nail a trailor park b**h
I met a s*ut and said ""what up, its nice to meet ya""
I'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza



But i'm broke as f** and i don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, i was bout to roll this next blunt
But i aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus i'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin funny
Cuz you know your stinkin a** is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun
Thats when her a** put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the gla** doors
Started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god i was smokin crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All i wanted to do was rape the b**h and snatch her purse
Now i wanna k** her
But so i gotta catch her first
Ran through rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her f**in porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced s*ut
Looked around the room
Thats when i seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there b**h! i got my gun co*ked!
You might as well come out now
She said ""come in, its unlocked!""
I walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay p**n
She said ""come her big boy, lets get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg ""no, please let go""
But she swallowed my f**in leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now i'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then i remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick!
Whipped that sh** out, and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted ""now b**h, lets see who gets the best!""
Stuffed that sh** in crooked and f**ed that fat s*ut to d**h (ahh!! ahhh!)
Come here b**h!
Come here!
Take this motherf**in dick!
b**h, come here!
Chorus to fade
And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
Every day
Every single day the world keeps turning

Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me

Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)



I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?

That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..

51,4 Verses,https://lyrics.az/eminem/the-freestyle-show/4-verses.html,eminem,"[Verse 1]
(Aight, aight...Uh...Slim Shady...Yo, yo, yo...)
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella into mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eating a four course meal, watching you starve to d**h
With an IV in your veins, feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of d**
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the a**es ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
As a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'M STILL ALIVE!""
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp, and
Pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start sh**
Got your b**h wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with
Motherf**er, Slim Shady b**h! Recognize!
[Verse 2]
Met a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the f**ing head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
f** an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers
We blowin' up your house, k**ing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats



I'm doin' drive-by's in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack
Today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strappin' more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Comin' together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherf**er!
[Verse 3]
(Like this, like that, like this
Like this, like that, like this)
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a f**ed up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And ain't sh** changed
I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of d**h
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
sh**, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
f** it, you only live once, you might as well die now
[Verse 4]
Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming ""GET HIM!""
I grabbed one, lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next f*ggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen
(Damn... damn... damn...)"

Woah, uh haydi ellerinizi havaya kaldırın
Ve alkışlayın
İleri geri çünkü
Bu basit bir şey değil
Bu biraderler Dirty Dozen'ı temsil ediyor
Be F-R-O çift G'yim
Ve adamıma bakın
Adı şey ımm, ee
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, beyin ölümü gerçekleşmiş Jim Brady gibidir
Ben bi' M-80'im, sen ise bücürsün Lil Kim' gibi
Haykırıyorum, Dirty Dozen
Yaramaz, küfürbaz bir kafiye ustasıdır
Siz oyunculara Marty Schottenheimer'dan daha pis söverim
Stilini kopyaladığın gavattan daha berbatsın
Çift CD'li albüm yapsan iki kopya bile satamazsın
Kabul et bunu sonra siktir et, hazır konusu açılmışken
Uyuşturucu alırım, patlarım ve sağlam tüttürürüm
Benim adım Marshall Mathers, ben alkoliğin tekiyim (Merhaba, Marshall!)
Bir rahatsızlığım var ama teşhis koyamıyorlar
Cüzdanını saklasan iyi edersin
Çünkü seni gasp etmek için yaklaşıyorum
Bir bilet aldım konserine ve sildim onunla kıçımı
Kaşar, geliyorum seni sopalamaya, o kadar hızlı döveceğim ki gözlerin görmeye yetişemeyecek
Mike Tyson gibi nakavt edeceğim
Kanıt puding'in içindedir, istersen DeShaun Holton'a sor
Ron Goldman'den daha fena seni doğrayacağım
[Nakarat]
O yüzden beni iki tane Glockla görürsen
2Pac gibi ""Dünyanın amına koyim"" diye bağırırken
Gram sikimde değil
Arkamdan atıp tutarsın
Arkadaşlarına benim müptezel olduğumu söylersin
Gram sikimde değil
Kasedimi tekrar koy rafa
Ve koş git arkadaşlarına kasedin boktan olduğunu söyle
Gram sikimde değil
Ama beni sokakta görürsen çöm yere
Çünkü hırpalanacaksın, vurulacaksın ve öldürüleceksin
Çünkü gram sikimde değil
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Pete'den daha hoşum, ama Miilkbone'u parçalamak için arayışlardayım
Ölümsüzüm, Vanilla Ice'ı silikon gibi eritirim
Sana ortada bir şey yokken dissleyecek kadar problemliyim
Havanın -20 derece olduğu kış gününden daha soğuğum



Baharatsız bir tadım
Gizli bir gösterimim
Derginize lafı veririştiririm ve yine de kötü eleştiri yapamazsınız
Kancığını terkettiririm
Folgers kristallerini koklatırım
Bu lirikal bir savaş, beyler; kuşanın silahlarınızı
Voltron gibi oluşur, seni omuz füzelerimle uçururum
Slim Shady, Eminem o eski adımdı (bye bye!)
Gasp ederim, kokain çekerim, kürtajı desteklerim
Patolojik yalancıyım, boyumdan büyük işlere kalkışırım
Yalnızım, budalayım, kendimim, arada sırada gözükürüm
Düşünmeden hareket ederim, içtikçe içerim, müptezelim
Yarı hayvan, yarı insanım
Ölünü atıyorum bedenin bir afgan dantelinden
Daha delikli haldeyken bir çöp konteynerına
[Nakarat]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Biri beni bu limuzinden çıkarsın, kafese sıkışmış bir iblisim
Sahnede Rage Against the Machine gibi haykırıyorum
Zalim olduğuma kendimi ikna ettim, bu kayıt devam ederken uyuşturucu alıyorum
Klinik açıdan beynim ölü, ikinci bir seçeneğe ihtiyacım yok
Bırak mücehveri direk kutsal hazineyi ortaya koyarım
Senin stilini çalacağım, sadece daha iyi yapmak için
Baskıya dayanamıyorum, kaşarlardan bıktım
Bulaşıkları yıkarken dırdır eden patronlardan da bıktım
Okulda ise pek fazla laf yapmazdım
Çünkü kafam bi' milyon olmakla meşguldü
Çok koşuşturduğum için suratım kızarmaktan bir hal oldu
Son Jim Beam içtim, o zaman yüzüm grileşti
8. sınıfta spor salonuna gittim, kadın yüzme takımına tecavüz ettim
Şaka yapıyorum sanma ben komedyen değilim
Çok fazla akli sorunlarım olduğu çin bu beni kokain çekmeye ve tüttürmeye itti
Kaldırımın üzerinden de giderim, toprak yolda da
Sonunda eve ulaştım ama içeri girmek için anahtarım yok

None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no n***a f** with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (b**h)
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your a** to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that sh** down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your sh** to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your a** crack
And blast that sh** to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullsh** and flow



Yo, you need to come with the real sk**s, and act like you know
[Chorus: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these sk**s you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know sh** so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your a** forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your f**ing memory
It's either them or me man, k** or be k**ed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his a** sh**ty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And f** Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack
[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these sk**s you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become"
