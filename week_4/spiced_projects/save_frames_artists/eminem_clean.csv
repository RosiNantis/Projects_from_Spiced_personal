In your swimming pool,eminem
Me and my brother ride,eminem
Like what happened to Chris Reeves' spine column,eminem
You about to see peace destroyed,eminem
I don't rap for the plaques,eminem

My contracts signed just for scraps,eminem
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em,eminem
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your cd stores,eminem
To get you wack n***a,eminem
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles,eminem
"Wanna stop it? you gon' need a priests, at least three swords",eminem
With a gun with a ? with a bat,eminem
And why I had to come back on these f*ggots who diss me is,eminem

"Mushed against your damn side, you puss",eminem
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup,eminem
Shot till you kiss,eminem
And thighs are squooshed,eminem
Between his stick shift in his friggin' pickup,eminem
And pucker up,eminem
What kind of attires that?,eminem
And drink like a hick redneck hill billy will til he gets hiccups! ?,eminem

n***a paralyzed from the neck down,eminem
Hard to describe in fact,eminem
When you add an i-n-g,eminem
My goon stick n***as,eminem
Startling violent perhaps,eminem
"Do put a ""K"" in front of that though, when I'm.C.",eminem
Turn soldiers to stick figures,eminem
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that,eminem
"I'm not the king of the microphone boo, it's more like a phone booth",eminem
Hand on triggers,eminem
